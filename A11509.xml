            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

theſe two treatiſes had beene compiled at this time, and vpon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. So directly &amp; particularly do they touch all thoſe points, that are materiall to be touched and handled in this queſtion. And indeed it was commonly ſo beleeued in this country, when they came firſt out, vntill many men had compared them, with the Ancient copies printed in <hi>Paris.</hi> 1494. But now theſe old impreſſions giue vs cauſe rather to think that there was in <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſome propheticall ſpirit, ioyned with that extraordinary portion of learning and piety, wherewith he was indued.

            <p>Whether the conſiderations of <hi>Gerſon</hi> containe error or not, wee ſhall ſee hereafter, when the obiections that are made againſt them, ſhall be examined: all which obiections (or oppoſitions) do either preſuppoſe things that by the booke it ſelfe appeare to be falſe, as that <hi>Gerſon</hi> wrote thoſe conſiderations in time of ſciſme, or they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe and aſſume that which is in controuerſie, and the very queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelfe, as namely that the <hi>Popes</hi> commandement to the <hi>Venetians</hi> is iuſt and lawfull, or elſe taking ſome ambiguous and doubtfull terme, that may haue a double vnderſtanding, and accordingly ſetling a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the one ſenſe, which is true, and ſo purchaſing it ſome credyt and aſsent in the readers minde, in the end the obiection concludes in the other ſenſe, which is falſe.</p>

            <p>I know not to what purpoſe, the author makes ſuch a floriſh of ſix kindes of liberty, ſeeing it is apparant to euery man, of what kinde of liberty the queſtion is now betwene vs. But if he will needes ſet forth all kindes of liberty, that are incident eyther to a priuate perſon, or a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, why doth he not as well mention the Eccleſiaſticall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and tell vs clearely what this is? being a matter ſo much debated and doubted of among the Canoniſts, as to this day it is not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? The eccleſiaſticall <hi>Hierarchie</hi> is ſurely a common wealth: yet I ſee not vnder which of thoſe ſix kinds, that liberty may be reduced, which is commonly attributed vnto it. And therefore in ſaying, that there are no more kindes of liberty, but thoſe ſix, he makes vs wonder, as if he meant to exclude or renounce that, whereof notwithſtanding there could not be a fitter place to ſpeake, nay, to treate fully and at large, then this wee haue now in hand. But foraſmuch as in this diſcourſe of the ſix kindes of liberty, the Author vſeth an ambiguous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it is neceſſary before wee go any further, to reſtraine and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the true ſenſe, leaſt any man be deceiued by it.</p>
            <p>Speaking of chriſtian liberty, he ſaith, that well a man may looſe it by
<pb facs="tcp:17244:5"/>
not obeying Chriſts vicar, but neuer by obeying him: this muſt bee thus limited, when Chriſts vicar commands according to Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. But when he commandes, according to his owne priuate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and paſſions, wherevnto as being a man he is ſubiect, and may be more ſubiect then many other, as <hi>Caietan</hi> ſaith 2. 2 <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 39. <hi>art.</hi> 2. then chriſtian liberty is not loſt by diſobeying him, but indeede by obeing him.</p>
            <p>As for example, that man ſhould no doubt haue loſt his lyberty, that had obeyed <hi>Honorius</hi> the firſt, commanding that no man ſhould affirme, that in Chriſt there was eyther on will or two, or he that ſhould haue obeyed <hi>Gregory</hi> the 3. ordeyning that it ſhould be lawfull for a man that had a wife, vnfit by reaſon of any infirmity for the vſe or act of matrimony, to take an other beſides her. And likewiſe, that ſhould haue obeyed the ſeuerall cenſures of <hi>Stephen.</hi> 6. againſt <hi>Formoſus,</hi> and of <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9. againſt <hi>Stephen.</hi> And of <hi>Sergius</hi> the 3. againſt <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9. And in like ſort if he had obeyed <hi>Celeſtin.</hi> 3. when he taught this doctrine, that marriage might be diſſolued for hereſye: nay he had vndoubtedly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that had obeyed <hi>Iohn.</hi> 22. and beleeued for obedience ſake, that the ſoules of the ſaintes deceaſed, did not ſee gods face. All which I haue heere breifly touched, to let the reader ſee, that this aſſerſion, that Chriſtian liberty may be loſt by diſobeying the Pope, but not by obeying him, may very well carry a good ſhew, but that it is with all deceiptfull and captious, beeing deliuered in ſuch a generality; and vnleſſe it be limitted with this reſtriction, when he commandes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to gods law.</p>
            <p>fourthly where he ſaith, that no Pope did euer attempt to change the forme of gouernment in the Citie of <hi>Venice.</hi> I will be bold to put the auctor in minde, that it is very much that he vndertakes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an abſolute negatiue, in a point of eccleſiaſticall hiſtory, for the ſpace of nine hundred yeares; during which time, there haue beene about nine hundred and fourty Popes ſince the firſt began to intermedle with temporall matters: of which number, as it is true that the moſt part haue fauoured that ſtate, ſo yet can it not bee truely ſayd of them all: although it hath pleaſed the diuine prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (almoſt) miraculouſly to protect and preſerue the liberty thereof, euen when it was apparant, that ſome did labour mightily to ouerthrow it vtterly.</p>
            <p>And further it may be well replied vnto him: that it ſeemes ſtrange
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17244:5"/>
and not to be endured. That noe Pope hauing euer before this time, according to the authors owne ſaying, attempted or prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to deſire, to alter the gouernment of that common wealth. This Pope ſhould be now ſo peremptory, and confident that he may doe it, by offering (as he doth) to intermedle with the making of their lawes, which is the very life and ſoule of ciuill gouernment.</p>
            <p>At laſt the author paſſing ouer that which made not much to the purpoſe, is contented to acknowledge that the tranſlator ſpeakes here of the liberty of a ſoueraigne Prince, which among other things conſiſteth in making lawes neceſſary for the good gouernment of his ſtate, and puniſhing offendors. And thus he goeth on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There remaineth only that liberty which belongeth to an abſolute Prince, that acknowledgeth no ſuperiour in temporall matters: and of this kinde of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, it is likely that the author of the preface ſpeaketh: But out of all question he is deceiued, in ſaying, that the Popes holineſſe ſends out excommunications againſt the ſtate of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice, for refuſing to ſubiect the liberty which God hath giuen them to the will of another. And if any man obiect, that to make lawes &amp; puniſh offendors, is the proper right of abſolute Princes, and yet Pope</hi> Paule <hi>the fift, excommunicates the heads and principall officers of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth of Venice, becauſe they will not obey him, in diſanulling &amp; recalling ſome lawes they haue made in temporall matters, &amp; in ſetting at libertie certaine offendors which they had put in priſon: I anſwere, that Pope</hi> Paule <hi>the fift, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the heades of that common wealth, for refuſing to obey him, in diſanulling not all lawes, or any lawe, concerning temporall matters, but vniust &amp; wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawes, made in preiudice of the Church, and with great offence to God and their neighbour. And who can or will deny, if he be a true Catholick that the Pope hath authority, as vniuerſall paſtour, to rebuke &amp; reprooue any Prince or ſtate for their ſins, &amp; if they refuſe to obey, to compell them vnto it by eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall cenſures. For accordingly we ſee, that S.</hi> Gregory <hi>did very ſharply reprooue tht Emperour</hi> Mauritius, <hi>for a law which he had made, that was preiudiciall to Gods ſeruice. And Innocent: the third, as wee may reade in the chapter. Nouit de iudicijs, doth plainly determine, that it belongeth to the Pope, to cenſure the ſinnes and offences of all the Princes of the world. Non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendimus</hi> ſaith he <hi>iudicare de feodo cuius ad ipſum (regem viz.) ſpectat iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium, ſed decernere de peccato, cuius ad nos pertinet ſine dubitatione cenſura, quam in quemlibet exercere poſſumus &amp; debemus.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Cum non humanae constitutioni<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſed diuinae potius innitamur, quia poteſtas nostra non eſt ex homine, ſed ex deo, nullus, qui ſit ſanae mentis ignorat, quin ad officium

noſtrum ſpectet, de quocunque mortali peccato corripere quemlibet Chriſtianum, &amp; ſi correptionem contempſerit, per diſtrictionem eccleſiaſticam coercere. Sea forſitan dicetur, quod aliter cum regibus &amp; aliter cum alijs eſt agendum. Caterum ſcriptum legimus in lege diuina, ita magnum iudicabis vt paruum: nec erit apud te except to perſonarum. Hitherto are the very words of Pope</hi> Innocent. <hi>And Pope</hi> Boniface <hi>in the extrauagant vnam ſanctam, de maiorit, &amp; obedient: Saith very well, that the temporall authority, when it erreth; ought to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>formed and rectified by the ſpirituall power. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a temporall prince that is abſolute, acknowledgeth no other temporall Prince for his ſuperiour, yet if he be a Chriſtian, he must of force acknowledge the head of all Chriſtendome, which is the Pope, Christs vicar in earth, to be his Superiour: which Soueraigne Biſhop or Pope, becauſe his chiefe end and care is the spirituall good of mens ſoules, doth not therefore intermedle in the gouernment of temporall princes, as long as they vſe not their authority, to the hurt of their owne ſoules and their ſubiects, or to the preiudice of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But when they do the contrary, hee both may and ought to put to his hand, and to bring them into the right way againe. And he that beleeues not this, is no true Catholike: and if any man ſhall obiect, that thoſe lawes of the</hi> Venetians, <hi>containe in them neither ſinne nor hurt to the Church, I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere him, that to determine, whether any law do containe ſin or preiudice to the Church, or not, belongs likewiſe to the Pope, who is the ſupreme and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Iudge of all; euen as to iudge, whether a ciuill contract offend in the ſinne of vſury, belongs properly to the ſame eccleſiaſticall Iudge, to whom the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of ſins (generally) appertaineth. So the Popes Holines blames not the Venetians for puniſhing their ſubiects that offend, but becauſe they preſume to lay hands vpon eccleſiaſticall perſons, which are ſubiect to no ſuperiour, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall: &amp; make no reckoning of the ſacred Canons, &amp; of the grieuous cenſures denounced againſt all ſuch, as lay hands vpon perſons conſecrated to God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoeuer will rightly conſider of this point without paſſion, ſhall finde that the Pope goeth not about to bereaue the State of</hi> Venice, <hi>of any other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but the liberty to do euill, which is not giuen of God, but of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and our owne corrupt nature, and is the ſelfe ſame thing with the bondage of ſinne, oppoſite to true Christian liberty. And as temporall Princes will not giue liberty to their ſubiects to robbe or kill, or commit any ſuch heinous offences; becauſe they are repugnant to the peace and good gouernment of their ſtates, ſo ought not the Pope, who is head of all Chriſtendome, to giue any liberty or permiſsion to Chriſtian Princes, to make lawes that ſhall be iniurious to the Church, or preiudiciall to the ſaluation of ſoules. And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17244:6"/>
as the good ſheapherd ought not to giue his flocke free liberty to wander where it listeth, and to feede vpon hearbs that bee ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, as the</hi> Venetians, <hi>vpon iuſt cauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, refuſe to admitte that liberty of conſcience, which all the heretickes of theſe times ſo much affect, becauſe they knowe it is nothing but a liberty to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to all kinde of errors, and therefore they are contented to countenance and aſſiſt the proceedings of the holy inquiſition: ſo ought they as little to couet this liberty, to make lawes repugnant to the honour of God, and displeaſing to their ſpirituall mother, which is the holy Church, and be rather glad to be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of their error, and corrected by their ſpirituall Father, which is Gods vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This whole diſcourſe deſerues to be particularly examined, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are all things true that he preſuppoſeth in it, neither can that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion be in any ſort deduced from them, that he would gather. After he hath alleadged the tranſlators words, which are theſe: <hi>his holineſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates the common wealth of</hi> Venice, <hi>for refuſing to ſubiect the liberty that God hath giuen them, to the commaund or will of an other:</hi> hee turnes them another way, ſaying, that the <hi>Pope</hi> excommunicates the heads of the common wealth. But if he will vouchſafe to looke vpon it, he ſhall finde that the tranſlator hath ſpoken truly, and that he hath cunningly and skilfully changed the names &amp; perſons, to excuſe a notable error. The <hi>Popes</hi> briefe preſented vpon Chriſtmas day, is thus ſuperſcribed &amp; directed. <hi>Marino Grimanno duci &amp; reipublicae venetorum,</hi> To <hi>Marino Grimanno</hi> Duke of Venice, and to the common wealth of the ſame. In this briefe, he commaunds them to whom hee writes, that vnder paine of excommunication <hi>latae ſententia,</hi> they doe diſannull and repeale each two lawes. The tranſlator therefore hath ſaid truly, that he excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates the common wealth; and the Author, to defend and couer a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious error, committed in excommunicating a community or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, contrary to the doctrine of all diuines and Canoniſts, and the papall conſtitutions themſelues; cunningly affirmeth: that he excommu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nicateth the heads of that common wealth. And he obſerueth the ſame art throughout, although the <hi>Pope</hi> not onely in this breife, but in that alſo which was preſented the fiue &amp; twenteth of Februarie, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17244:7"/>
in expreſſe termes, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. And in the laſt breife of the ſeuenteenth of Aprill, excommunicateth alſo the Duke and the Senate or Councell, which is likewiſe a Colledge or community: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee will deſire the Author henceforth, to ſpeake clearely &amp; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and confeſſe, that the <hi>Pope</hi> excommunicates the common wealth, and the Senate or Counſell, and tell vs no more of the heads or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall magiſtrates, for ſuch excuſes can not be admitted, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be required. The error was committed indeede in exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating a community, But let it be defended by ſome other meanes, rather then by truſting vpon our groſeneſſe &amp; dulneſſe in diſcouering his cunning. It is alſo worthy to bee obſerued, with what modeſty hee ſpeaks of a common wealth, whereunto the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> hath beene ſo much beholden and obliged; and not onely of the men that are aliue now, whereof the preſent State is conſtituted and compounded, but of all thoſe which haue liued ſince the yeare 1300. vntill this time; tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lawes that were made by them to bee vniuſt &amp; impious, though with ſome contradiction to his owne Doctrine: for a little after; hee ſaith that it belongs to the <hi>Pope</hi> to iudge of Princes lawes, and the <hi>Pope</hi> hath neuer yet pronounced that theſe lawes are vniuſt and impious; whence then ſhall we ſay that the Author hath fetcht thoſe epithetes modeſty becomes all men well: vnleſſe peraduenture great perſons &amp; ſuch as cary the tytle of <hi>illustriſſime,</hi> be out of the rule.</p>
            <p>Two things he propoſeth: the one, that theſe lawes of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> are vniuſt &amp; wicked; the other, that it belongs to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to reproue them for it, and if they obey not, to compell them vnto it by his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The former which is the Principall, and wherein he ought cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue inſiſted, and to haue prooued it to be ſo, he is contented to bawke altogither; peraduenture becauſe he ſawe hee was not able to make it good. The ſecond, which is of little moment, vnleſſe hee had prooued the former, he goeth about to confirme at large, by three au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and other reaſons. But let vs followe his owne order, and ſee how well he hath prooued his purpoſe; and firſt by the authority of Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> who (as he ſaith) did ſharply reprooue the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Mauritius.</hi> In the threescore and firſt epiſtle of the ſecond booke, there is contayned, a very humble aduertiſement or remonſtrance of Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> to <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, vpon occaſion of a law he had made, that no man, that was tyed to ſerue in the warre, or in any publicke charge, might become a monke, vntill hee had giuen vp his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17244:7"/>
account, and finiſhed his time of ſeruice in the warres. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſheweth, that their accounts might be as well made, when they were entred into the monaſtery; and that a ſouldior becomming a Conuert, might profit the common wealth more by his prayers, then by his ſouldiorye, and that this law in generall, was a hinderance to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God. But let vs ſee how ſharpe his reproofe is, firſt he ſaith. <hi>Ego autem indignus veſtrae pictatis famulus in hac ſuggeſtione, ne<expan>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17244:8"/>
publiſheth: wherein he makes the Pope ſupreame temporall Monarch, and the Princes of the world leſſe then his vaſſals; as I will ſhew him (before we part out of this argument) that his words do neceſſarily infer, although they dare not yet auow it in expreſſe termes. But before we goe from this point, it will not bee vnpertinent for mee to let the Author know, in what Court of Chauncery, or <hi>campo di ſancto fiore</hi> it was, that Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> cauſed this his ſharpe reprehenſion or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to bee publiſhed, and ſet vp to bee read. In this 64. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hee writes to one <hi>Theodorus</hi> Phyſition to <hi>Mauritius,</hi> that hee had made a remonſtrance vnto the Emperour (for ſo I will bee bold to interpret <hi>ſuggeſtionem,</hi> yet with the Authors leaue, leaſt hee taxe mee as hee doth the Tranſlator) but that hee was not willing that his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſhould preſent it vnto him publiklie, but prayed that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> rather to deliuer it vnto him priuatelie, at ſome conuenient time, when it might not diuert him from greater buſineſſe. I muſt alſo craue pardon, if whiles wee talke of the maior propoſition, by occaſion of Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> words, I ſhall incidentally touch a point belonging to the minor. To ſhew the iniquitie of that law of <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius,</hi> that holy man prayeth him to inquire and ſearch, whether any Prince before him had made any law of that nature. So I would haue wiſhed, that our holy father the Pope, had in like ſort required the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians to conſider, whether any king of Portugall, Caſtile, Arragon, Poland, France, Sicilie, or any counte of Burgandy, or the ſtate of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, had euer made any lawes like vnto theirs. For ſo he ſhould haue truely imitated Saint <hi>Gregory.</hi> And ſurely I cannot but admire the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors great wiſedome, in that he forbeares to quote the place it ſelfe of Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> being ſo preciſe and ſubtile in his allegation of other places, throughout this whole Treatiſe.

            <p>After long warres betweene <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> King of France, and <hi>Richard</hi> King of England, about the yeare 1199. <hi>Richard</hi> died, and his brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Lackeland,</hi> ſucceeded him in that Kingdom, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the nomination &amp; appointment of his brother as ſome affirme, or by vſurpation vpon <hi>Arthur,</hi> who was ſon to another Elder brother of his.

But at length, in the yeare 1200: by meanes of a marriage betweene
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17244:8"/>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> ſon &amp; heire, &amp; ſucceſſor of the French king, <hi>Blanche</hi> of Caſtille, king <hi>Iohns</hi> ſiſters daughter (of which mariage iſſued afterward S. <hi>Lewis</hi>) a peace was concluded betweene <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> wherein <hi>Arthur</hi> was likewiſe compriſed: vpon this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition; that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould do homage to <hi>Philip,</hi> for the Dominions of Brittany &amp; Normandy, and <hi>Arthur</hi> ſhould do homage to <hi>Iohn</hi> for the ſame. After this, vpon ſome occaſion that fell out, <hi>Arthur</hi> was put in priſon by his vncle the King of England, and there died, in the yeere 1203. And the common opinion was, that hee was murthered by his Vncles commaundement. Whereupon <hi>Philip Auguſtus,</hi> as chiefe Lord of the Fee, cauſed <hi>Iohn</hi> to be cited to Paris: and vpon default of his appearance, condemned him, and confiſcated thoſe territories which he held of him, and went afterwards with an armie, to ſeiſe them into his hands by force. <hi>Iohn</hi> pretended, that this was directly againſt the peace and treaties betweene them, and made his complaint vnto Pope <hi>Innocent:</hi> the third, who commaunded both the Kings, vpon paine of excommunication, to keepe peace, and to ſurceaſe from warre, and ſent alſo a Legate vnto them for that purpoſe. <hi>Iohn,</hi> for whoſe aduantage this commaundement was, did gladly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it. But <hi>Philip</hi> found himſelfe much grieued, and tooke great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt it, and ſo did the Prelates of France in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: vnto whom <hi>Innnocent</hi> the third, made that anſwere contained in the Chapter <hi>nouit. Philip,</hi> for all that, deſiſted not from his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer purpoſe, but went on, and conquered by the ſword,, all the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories that the Engliſh men at that time poſſeſſed in France: neither could the Pope preuaile any thing by his commaundement. In the yeare 1208. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. excommunicated the aforeſaid <hi>Iohn,</hi> and interdicted his whole kingdome, which interdict continued ſix years and three moneths: Yet did not <hi>Iohn</hi> yeeld to obey the Pope, in that he required of him. Therefore the Pope ſent <hi>Pandolphus</hi> his Legat into France to <hi>Philip,</hi> to perſwade him to make warre vpon <hi>Iohn. Philip</hi> made his preparations accordingly, and many Barons of England com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined themſelues with him. But in the meane time, <hi>Pandolphus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into England, and letting <hi>Iohn</hi> ſee the daunger wherein he ſtood, aduiſed him to become the Popes Feodatary: <hi>Iohn</hi> inforced by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent perill, accepted the aduiſe, and made his kingdome tributary to the Pope, to pay him yearely 1000 markes of gold. <hi>Pandolphus</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon returned into France, and commaunded <hi>Philip,</hi> vpon paine of excommunication, that he ſhould moleſt <hi>Iohn</hi> no longer, as being now become the Feodatary of the Church. But <hi>Philip</hi> refuſed to obey, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17244:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the warre continued. Whereupon in the yeare 1215. in the Counſell of Lateran, Pope <hi>Innocent.</hi> Sent out an Excommunication againſt all thoſe that moleſted <hi>Iohn</hi> King of England for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> cauſe, and for that cauſe in the yeere 1216. another Legate called <hi>Guallo</hi> went to Paris, who by vertue of that ſentence of Excommunication, commaunded <hi>Philip</hi> &amp; <hi>Lewis</hi> his ſonne, to forbeare to paſſe with an Armie into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which they were then prepared to doe. But all this notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Lewis</hi> deſiſted not, but entered <hi>Iohns</hi> kingdome with a great power. Although the ſame <hi>Guallo</hi> were gone ouer into England, and there ceaſed not daily to thunder out his Excommunications. This warre continued vntill the death of <hi>Iohn;</hi> after which, <hi>Lewis</hi> of France who had gotten many places of that kingdome into his hands, made truce for fiue yeeres with <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iohn,</hi> who ſucceeded his father. Now to applie this ſtorie to our purpoſe: The Lawyers hold, that to ſhew that you haue commaunded, is not ſufficient to prooue a Iuriſdiction, vnleſſe the commaundement haue beene obeyed. I will leaue it therefore to the authors exquiſite iudgement, to make the concluſion that followes of this, ſeeing that ſo many commandements, and ſo many Cenſures of the Pope, were not able to withhold or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe two Kings, <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Lewis,</hi> from proſecuting theſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which they tooke to be iuſt, although the Pope iudged them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt. I will ſay thus much more: That Cardinall <hi>Hostienſis,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſhortly after, writing vpon this Chapter <hi>nouit,</hi> takes much paines to defend it, and propoſeth many coniectures of his owne, how and with what limitations the matter muſt be carried, to make that rule or precept of the Popes, deliuered in that chapter, to appeare iuſt; But it ſufficeth that in France it was not ſo eſteemed nor obeyed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the authoritie of that chapter <hi>nouit,</hi> there can be no ſuch thing concluded, as our author would inferre.</p>
            <p>The propoſition of Pope <hi>Innocent.</hi> 3. alledged by the author, <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus decernere de peccato cuius ad nos pertinet ſine dubitatione cenſura:</hi> and the other which followeth: <hi>nullus qui ſit ſanae mentis ignoart, quin ad offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um noſtrum spectet, de quocun<expan>

And all diuines
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17244:9"/>
and Canoniſts do agree, that in the excommunications graunted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hereticks, thoſe are not compriſed which erre onely mentally. And that any Canon that ſhould be made to comprehend them, were of no validity. So as here will be a generall propoſition framed: That the Pope may iudge of all ſins, which when we come to defend, we muſt be forced to except the greater part of particular ſins. Beſides, a prince may ſin by breaking his owne lawes without iuſt cauſe; as ſaint <hi>Thomas</hi> proues 1.2. <hi>quaest.</hi> 96. <hi>art.</hi> 5. And yet of this ſinn a he cnnot be iudged of any, but god alone: <hi>Caietan</hi> in that place, declareth, ſhewing that in <hi>foro poenitentiae,</hi> and in the ſight of God is all one in ſenſe. Certainly, to affirme that a prince doing againſt his owne lawes, ſhould be therein ſubiect to the cenſures of the Pope, were wholy to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the power and authority of princes. And one the other ſide, to affirme that he ſhould be ſubiect to them in other crimes, and not in that, were to ouerhrow the very ground of the reaſon preſuppoſed in that chapter <hi>nouit.</hi> Namely, that it belongs to the Pope, to take care of the ſoules and ſaluation of men, and to remoue all things that be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe or repugnant thereunto. But a Prince may incurre damnation by the ſinnes he committes againſt his owne lawes, therefore as well of theſe ſinnes, as other, it belonges to the Pope to iudge: which as I ſayd before, is directly contrary to the doctrine of Saint <hi>Thomas.</hi> Moreouer it is neceſſarie, well to obſerue the very words of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent:</hi> where he ſaith, that the cenſure of euery mortall ſinne belongs vnto him; <hi>quam cenſuram in que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>libet exercere poſſumus &amp; debemus.</hi> And a little after, <hi>ad officium noſtrum ſpectat de quocun<expan>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet chriſtianum.</hi> Now if he be bound (by the duty of his place) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce cenſures againſt euery mortall ſinne, &amp; againſt euery chriſtian ſo offending, ſurely if he do it not, he ſinnes himſelfe: But we do not ſee that the Pope ſends out any cenſures againſt the courtiſans and profeſt harlots, who yet perſiſt and abide notoriouſly in their ſinnes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eyther he muſt needes ſinne grieuouſly, or it will behooue him to do nothing elſe but thunder out cenſures, ſo as thoſe words, <hi>de omni peccato mortali,</hi> are not to be vnderſtood generally of ſinnes, ſeeing we haue already ſhewed ſo many inſtances of particulars to be excepted. And therefore <hi>Gabriell Biell:</hi> vpon the <hi>Can. Lec.</hi> 75. Laboureth much to giue ſome tollerable interpretation to this place, but can find none but this, that this decretall and all other of the ſame tenor, muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtode in <hi>foro poenitentiae</hi> only. I wil not trouble my ſelfe to proue that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17244:10"/>
the words of the decretall are to be vnderſtood as <hi>Gabriell</hi> interprets them. I will only ſay this, that whoſoeuer wil affirme, that they are to be vnderſtood in <hi>foro exteriori,</hi> ſhall haue much to doe to auoyd the abſurdities, and the vtter ouerthrow of the ſeculer power ordeyned of god, and the confution of the world, which will ariſe out of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; beſides the ſtate of damnation, whereinto he plungeth all Popes by the ſame. In which point ſome canoniſts, and Nauarro among the reſt haue taken much paines, but with no good ſucceſſe, neyther need we trauell much to reconcile and fit the words of this Pope to the true doctrine, which diſtinguiſheth the ſeculer power, from the ſpirituall authoritie; eſpecially ſeeing the ſame decretall conteyneth ſome other things, which had need to be well expounded: as namely this, that K. <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> was of the ofſpring (<hi>e genere</hi> as he ſaith) of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, which is not true vnleſſe he ſuppoſe and imagine ſome mariage, and ſo deriue the deſcent by the way of ſome woman; a thinge neuer vſed in France.</p>
            <p>A certaine french Hiſtoriographer deriues the howſes of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne</hi> and <hi>Capet,</hi> from <hi>Merone,</hi> by linial deſcent of ſeuerall women. But to ſhew that the houſe of <hi>Capet,</hi> comes of <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> wil be very hard, without deuiſing ſome thing without the compaſe of al ſtories.</p>
            <p>It is time to get out of this chapter <hi>nouit,</hi> which the author in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhould haue bin careful rather to haue expounded, then to inlarge it, and extend it as he hath done, for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the meaning of <hi>Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:</hi> who ſaith, that to him did belong the correction of euery chriſtian, our author hath interpreted theſe words, <hi>quemlibet chriſtianum,</hi> al the Princes of the world.

            <p>But of priuate Chriſtians, which Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> intended to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, the author; thought not good to make any motion: as if it were ſufficient to haue commaund and rule ouer Princes, and an Indignity and an abaſement to intermedle with other.

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:17244:10"/>
I would be glad the Author would reſolue vs of a doubt, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the reading and comparing of this extrauagant, with an other of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fift, who came not long after him, which begins thus: <hi>Meruit de Priuilegiis:</hi> Where <hi>Clement</hi> ſaith, that he determineth and declareth, that by the aforeſaid extrauagant, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nam ſanctam,</hi> there ſhall be no preiudice or iniurie done to the King and Kingdome of France, nor that the ſaid king and kingdom, ſhal be any more or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſubiect to the Church of Rome, then they were before; but that all things ſhall continue, in the ſtate they were in before that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagant. And this he profeſſeth to do, to ſhew fauour to that King, who was worthy of it, both for his owne good affection, and for the merits of his anceſtors, and in reſpect the whole nation of the French had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued it by their true pietie and ſincere deuotion. Hereupon I aske this queſtion: Whether <hi>Boniface,</hi> in this extrauagant, <hi>Vnam ſanctam,</hi> did make a declaration of <hi>Ius diuinum,</hi> in this point (that is expound and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the iuriſdiction which the Pope hath, <hi>De iure diuino,</hi> ouer Princes: or whether he did thereby impoſe a new ſubiection ouer Princes, in ſome matters, wherein God had not made them ſubiect before vnto the Popes. If any man ſhall anſwere it was the latter, I may then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that is was an innouation after 1250. yeares, a void act, an vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an incrochment, and an abuſe of the power giuen them by God. Beſides in this caſe, it was not fit that <hi>Clement</hi> ſhould declare or meane, that <hi>France</hi> alone ſhould bee exempted from that conſtitution, but it behooued him to declare and determine the ſame; for all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Kingdomes. Neyther was it a matter of fauour, to be yeelded as in recompence of the good deſertes of that King or Kingdome, but a thing due vnto them of right and Iuſtice. But if it be anſwered: That it was a declaration of <hi>ius diuinum,</hi> I would faine know then, how <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> could free the King &amp; Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> from that ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God had appointed them vnto; the caſe beeing very cleare, that the Pope cannot exempt any man, from his owne power and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction which he holds <hi>de iure diuino.</hi> But to come to the very point of that extrauagant, which the Author alleadgeth: if that which <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> ſaith, to wit: That the authoritie temporall, when it erreth, ought to bee corrected and rectified by the ſpirituall: bee a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the lawe of God, I ſay that it ought to bee vnderſtood onely for ſo much as concernes the ſaluation of their Soules, and in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> and without any temporall power of that kinde which the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17244:11"/>
Lawyers terme <hi>Coactiue,</hi> and that all the Eccleſiaſticall power ouer Princes is therefore onely ſpirituall. And heerein we ſhall not neede to goe ſo farre as to the Pope of Rome: for this kinde of authoritie is as well in euerie Prelate; though betweene him and them there be this difference, that other Prelates haue no ſuch generall power and commaund ouer all, as the Pope hath; and that their authoritie is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate vnto his. But whereas, out of thoſe three authorities before mentioned he concludes, that a temporall abſolute Prince, although he recognize the other temporall Prince for his ſuperiour, yet of neceſſitie he muſt recognize the head of all Chriſtendome; I would not that any man ſhould be deceiued, by the Equiuocation and ambiguitie which reſts in theſe two words, <hi>Recognize</hi> and <hi>Superiour:</hi> for in one ſenſe, to recognize him, is as much to ſay, as to be ſubiect to his lawes, and doe homage vnto him, and to acknowledge that you hold your ſtate by his fauour: In an other ſenſe, to recogniſe him, is no more but to account him the Miniſter of God, in matters which concernes the kingdome of heauen. In which ſenſe, I ſay and affirme, that Princes doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge or recognize the Pope, but the Biſhop alſo. The word Superiour likewiſe in the former ſenſe, ſignifieth that which in our common ſpeech, we terme Lord of the fee or Superiour of <hi>Dominium directum.</hi> But in the latter ſenſe, <hi>Superior</hi> ſignifies no more, but one that teacheth the Law of God, miniſtreth the Sacraments, and generally directeth men the right way to eternall ſaluation. In which ſenſe, I ſay, that euen the Biſhop alſo is Superiour to a Prince, although the Pope be <hi>Superior</hi> in a higher and greater meaſure. It is not fit therefore that the Author ſhould, without diſtinguiſhing theſe two ſignifications affirme in groſſe and in one breath as it were, that an abſolute Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Prince, although he acknowledge the ſuperioritie of no other Temporall Prince, ought yet to recogniſe the Pope for his ſuperiour, and ſo confound the two ſuperiorities. For if it ſhould be thus propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that an abſolute Temporall Prince, though he acknowledge no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Temporall Prince for his ſuperiour, yet muſt acknowledge the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to be his ſuperiour, no man would allow of it, becauſe the fallacie would be apparant to all men. Therfore if <hi>Recogniſing</hi> be vnderſtood in the former ſenſe (in caſe) of <hi>Dominium directum,</hi> I ſay, that it is not true, that a Prince ought ſo to recogniſe the Pope. For the Pope is not ſuch vnto him; but that in the ſame manner that he recognizeth no other Prince, he ought as little or leſſe to recognize the Pope himſelfe. But if

ſuperiour be vnderſtood in the ſecond ſenſe, for a Spirituall ſuperiour, it is not true that any Temporall Prince, though otherwiſe a Feodatary or Homager, doth or can acknowledge any other Temporal Prince for ſuch a ſuperior. For in this ſenſe, to acknowledge one for a ſuperiour, is as much as to account or accept him for a ſpirituall Father. And for ſuch a one, the homager ought not to acknowledge his Lord. How ought wee therefore to beware of deliuering ſuch diuinitie, whereby both the kingdome of God, and the kingdomes of the world are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered and confounded, and the ſimple people abuſed, and made to beleeue, that in all things they are bound to obey the Pope?</p>
            <p>Neither is the manner or Phraſe of ſpeech abſolutely to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that that Pope is head of all Chriſtendome, by reaſon of the Equiuocation of the word <hi>Chriſtendome.</hi> Among the ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters we finde him thus ſtiled, The Biſhop of Rome, the ſucceſſour of Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> by ſome, Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Vicar; and in the latter times, Chriſts Vicar, Gods Vicar, head of the Church: faſhions of ſpeech, which begets no ill meaning: But it is otherwiſe, in the vſe of the word <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> in this place, by reaſon of the ambiguitie and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe which it hath. For it ſignifieth not onely the Chriſtian Church, but the Chriſtian ſtates and kingdomes: and this latter ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the more vſuall; as when wee ſay, that Aſia or Aegypt are not within Chriſtendome, we doe not meane, that there is no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church in them, but that they are not within the compaſſe of the Temporal ſtates of the Chriſtians. So it is apparent, that vnder this new forme of ſpeech the fallacy is hidden. For his purpoſe is to conclude, that the Pope is head, that is, hath the gouernment &amp; command in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters, ouer all Chriſtian States and Princes. Let vs therefore keepe our antient formes, and let vs call him head of the Chriſtian Church. But ſeeing the Authors drift is, out of this whole diſcourſe to draw this concluſion, that where Princes vſe their power to the hurt of their owne ſoules, or their peoples, and to the preiudice of Chriſtian religion, the Pope may take the matter in hand to redreſſe it: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee haue ſpoken much of this point before in the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chapter <hi>Nouit;</hi> it will not bee impertinent to our preſent purpoſe, to conſider what notable inconueniences will follow in this Doctrine, thus generally deliuered. There is no action of a man <hi>in indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiduo,</hi> but either it is a good worke, or a ſinne. Now if it belong to the Pope, to exerciſe iuriſdiction ouerall ſinnes, and withall to take
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17244:12"/>
vpon him to determine, what is ſinne, and what not, I ſay, there is no longer any Prince but the <hi>Pope,</hi> nay further, that there is no place left for any priuate gouernment. For ſuppoſe the Prince make a lawe to exact ſome contribution, for the extraordinary reliefe of the ſtate, by occaſion of ſome warre that hee is forced to vndertake, this lawe is not iuſt, but a ſinne, vnleſſe the end and ground of it bee lawfull, and vnleſſe the ſubiects doe ſubmit and binde themſelues to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, according to the rules of <hi>iuſtitia diſtributiua,</hi> hereupon the <hi>Pope</hi> may ſay, I will know the end why this taxe is impoſed, and ſo he may diue into the ſecrets of that eſtate: hee may alſo examine the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution, whether it bee equally and proportionably made, and thereby come to the knowledge of the ſecret of the forces, and wealth of that ſtate: And beeing a temporall <hi>Prince</hi> himſelfe, who in that right and quality, may haue occaſion of warre with an other <hi>Prince,</hi> by this courſe, it will bee an eaſie matter for him to infeable his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and to get the maiſtery of him at an eaſie rate. In ſumme, the <hi>Pope</hi> may (by this Doctrine) examine all lawes, all edicts, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, all ſucceſſions, and all tranſlations of <hi>Princes,</hi> what ſhall I ſay? hee may call in queſtion, and examine all inheritances and contracts of priuate men; becauſe it belongs to the ſheepherd, (as the Author ſaith) to haue a care, of what his ſheepe doe feede, of what waters they drynke, and where they haue their walke: and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference doth not onely neceſſarily follow of this ſuppoſition, but is alſo allowed by all the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> that write vpon that chapter <hi>Nouit:</hi> and yet neuertheleſſe, haue the wiſeſt men and of moſt vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, noted and taxed it to bee full of abſurdities. Which to auoide, ſome men haue out of that Chapter <hi>Nouit,</hi> framed a diſtinction: That it is one thing to iudge of the matter, or of the action, or of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract, and an other to iudge of the ſinne. But they make a deuiſion where there can bee none: for if it be the Popes right to iudge of all things as they are ſinnes, and to forbid them, and inforce all men to obey his determinations therein; what is there more left then for the Prince to do? for example, if there ſhould be any bargaine and ſale made wherin there were Iniquitie and Iniuſtice, and the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould determine it to be ſinne, and cauſe it to be reuoked; I would gladly knowe, what there remaines for the Prince to intermedle in, or to determine further touching that contract? And I will hold my ſelfe ſatisfied, if any man can ſhew me that there is left for the Prince as much as one of <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:17244:12"/>
motes. Surely by this Doctrine, either all authority of Princes muſt be aboliſhed, or Chriſtendome muſt bee holden in perpetuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion. And here I vſe not the word in any ambiguous ſenſe: but I vnderſtand by Chriſtendome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all Chriſtian ſtates &amp; Kingdomes. And becauſe the Author hath taught vs a very generall doctrine; that, to iudge whether any lawe containe in it ſinne or not; It belongs to the <hi>Pope:</hi> as it belongs to the eccleſiaſticall Iudge, to determine whether a ciuill contract containes in it the ſinne of vſurie: I muſt bee bold to tell him, that from hence it will follow, that not onely the <hi>Pope,</hi> but euery eccleſiaſticall Iudge, ſhall haue power to determine of all matrers; for it can belong no more to him, to iudge whether a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract offend in vſury, then whether it cary with it, any other wrong or hurt to a mans neighbour: for all that doe ſo, are ſinnes, aſwell as the other. And by the ſame reaſon, it will belong to the eccleſiaſticall Iudge, to determine of all manner of murther, or killing of a man, becauſe it may be ſo done as it ſhall be a ſinne, and it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And to them it ſhall likewiſe belong, to iudge of the price ſet vpon Corne, and other marchandiſe, whether there bee ſinne in it or not, and to appoint that it ſhall either ſtand or be altered: and whether a morgage containe extortion or not, or a warrant for the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and impriſoning of a man, containe violence or Iniuſtice; (for euen in theſe matters there may bee ſinne) and whether the womens attire be ſcandalous, or the men bee too ſuperfluous or too ſparing in the expence of their table: for euen all theſe are ſinnes. And as they may by this meanes intrude themſelues into the gouernment of all kingdomes, ſo may they likewiſe, into the gouernment of particular families, and examine how the father gouernes his children, or the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band vſeth his wife. And in concluſion, becauſe there is no action or affaire, other publick or priuate, wherunto ſin is not incident, if it ſhall be in the power of the eccleſiaſticall Iudge to determine &amp; iudge of it, &amp; either to allow it, or forbid it, &amp; to inforce obedience vnto his owne determination: All Courts of iuſtice, all places of contracts, and all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate families, may well be transferred into the Biſhops pallace. And as theſe conſequences are neceſſarily deduced from this doctrine, ſo it were well, that they ſhould be throughly &amp; with good inſight conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of by them, to whome indeede they belong. But the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine and the common practiſe which we daily ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> auoids all theſe abſurdities, ſubiecting all Crimes and offences vnto the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17244:13"/>
Iuriſdiction <hi>in foro mundano,</hi> and to the eccleſiaſticall <hi>in foro animae:</hi> wherein how men ought to proceede, wee can not bee better taught, then by the example of Chriſt and his holy Apoſtles, who neuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to haue or exerciſe any temporall coertion or coactiue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ouer (mens) ſinnes. But the <hi>Author</hi> goeth on, and inueyeth againſt the tranſlator, not only in the point concerning the lawes, but addeth further, that his holineſſe is not offended with the common wealth of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> for puniſhing their ſubiects that offend, but for preſuming to lay hands vpon eccleſiaſticall perſons, who are not ſubiect to any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, but the eccleſiaſticall: and he concludeth, that whoſoeuer will conſider of the matter without paſſion ſhall finde, that the <hi>Pope</hi> goeth not about to depriue that common wealth of any other liberty, but the liberty to doe euill, which is not giuen of God, but of the Diuell. Here firſt he layeth to the tranſlators charge, that, wherein hee is not faulty at all: yet hath he truly cited the words of the tranſlator: namely, that the Popes cenſure was denounced vpon Chriſtmas day. But vpon that day, there was no breefe of the <hi>Popes</hi> preſented, but that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned onely the two lawes; That neither Churches ſhould be built, nor lands conueyed by laymen to eccleſiaſticall perſons, without leaue of the State. And that other cenſure, for iudging and puniſhing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Churchmen delinquents, came not out till Februarie: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be mentioned by the tranſlator, writing as he doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a report which was ſpread abroad of the cenſures denounced vpon Chriſtmas day. Surely a perſon of grauity ought not to ſtirre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy againſt an other man, but vpon true grounds. But to the matter it ſelfe. The eccleſiaſticall perſons offending againſt a lawe, are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to puniſhment, he onely ſaith it, but prooues it not. If wee finde hereafter that he goeth about to prooue it, we will anſwere him, as ſhall be meete for the defence of the truth. But in the meane time, I may not deferre to ſay, what is fit to be ſaid, concerning that propoſition of his: Eccleſiaſticall perſons (ſaith he) are not ſubiect to any, but their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſuperior. This very propoſition is produced as a ſpeciall obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> by a certaine Frenchman who condems it, as tending onely to ſedition. And <hi>Lewes Richehomme</hi> the prouinciall of the Ieſuites, in an Apology of his directed vnto the King of Fraunce; anſweres in the Cardinals behalfe, in the 33. Chapter, that hee doth not affirme this poſition, but onely in cauſes meerely ſacred, as of faith, religion, Sacraments &amp;c. and that it was not his meaning to taxe or

reprooue the cuſtome of France, where the ſecular magiſtrate vſeth to iudge of crimes, which are ſpecially reſerued to the eccleſiaſticall courts. And the ſame prouinciall, turning his ſpeech afterwards to the King, ſay thus. <hi>Epiſcopi Archiepiſcopi, Cardinales, generaleſ<expan>

And the ſecond concluſion with the reaſon he renders for it, ſaith, not by way of argument or queſtion, but definitiuely, that eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perſons, are ſubiect to ſecular Princes.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this word <hi>ſubditi</hi> is not there (ſo) formally expreſſed, I thought better to alleage one of his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, that in expreſſe and direct termes hath ſaid it: &amp; not only in that place before cited, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats it alſo in the 36. chapter. I forbeare to vouch S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle mentioned before, where he calls himſelfe the ſubiect &amp; ſlaue, or ſeruant of the <hi>Emperor:</hi> And brings in God ſpeaking thus vnto him. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotes meos tuae manui co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miiſi:</hi> which manner of ſpeech, I finde to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary with the holy Fathers, &amp; frequent in the Epiſtles of the Ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Popes.</hi> And here me thinks a man might wel reply vpon the Author, that this ſaying of his, (that the Pope went not about to debarre the ſtate of <hi>Venice</hi> of any other liberty, but to do euill) may more truly be applied to them: and it may be ſaid, that the ſtate of <hi>Venice</hi> in puniſhing Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that offend, do not any thing againſt the eccleſiaſticall liberty, nor go about to take any other liberty fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, but liberty to doe euill: for we be all agreed in this; That eccleſiaſticall perſons breaking a law, do therein ſinne: But in the other point we do not agree, that the common wealth hath ſinned in correcting them.</p>
            <p>I am prone to beleeue, that the Author beeing ſo exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well learned as hee is, had a good meaning, when hee ſaide, that the libertye to doe euill, is not giuen by GOD, but by the Diuell. Yet thoſe wordes ſo deliuered are not Catholicke: for by libertie to doo euill, is vnderſtood free-will, which is naturall and of God: and this will bee denied by none but <hi>Manicheus,</hi> who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17244:14"/>
makes the Diuell Author of it. But I doe not denie, as I ſaid, but the Author might haue a good meaning in it. Yet a good meaning is ſcarſe to be allowed for an excuſe vnto him, that is ſo ſeuere and rigorous a <hi>Cenſor</hi> of other men: Eſpecially conſidering what Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, <hi>ex verbis male prolatis incurritur haereſis.</hi> The Author proceedes, and by a compariſon drawne from ſecular Princes, from a ſheepheard and a Pilot; he concludes, that the Pope, Head of Chriſtendome, ought not to allow any liberty vnto Princes, to make lawes that be preiudiciall to the Church &amp; the ſaluation of mens ſouls, and whereby they procure damnation both to themſelues and others. Theſe are goodly words at the firſt ſight, and ſuch as are able to ſtagger a ſimple man by and by, and to make him thinke, that the author hath all right and reaſon on his ſide. But when we ſhall examine and ſift them, we ſhall finde them to containe nothing but ambiguities, and to conclude with the like <hi>Paralogiſme</hi> that the reſt haue done. For firſt, what meaneth he by the Church? If the ſame which the holy Scripture meaneth, and which the word it ſelfe doth properly ſignifie, to wit, the company of the faithfull; it is verie true that he ſaith: But in this ſenſe, no Prince can make lawes hurtfull to the Church, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they muſt be hurtfull to himſelfe alſo (who i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a principall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it) and hee muſt needs ſinne in ſo doing: Likewiſe if by the Church he vnderſtand the miniſters thereof, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as much as they be miniſters, I am of the ſame opinion: But I adde this withall, that theſe lawes of Venice, are not any way hurtful or preiudiciall to them, but rather, as may eaſily be prooued, they tend in ſome ſort to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and benefit of their calling. But if by the Church, he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſome temporall power or ſtate, I denie that the Pope hath any right to hinder, or prohibite lawes to be made, to the preiudice of the Church in that ſenſe. The ambiguitie of the word doth deceiue vs. It is true, that no man ought to make lawes that are hurtfull to the Church: but this muſt be vnderſtood of the Church in the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſignification. But if a Law be made againſt carrying of corne to <hi>Ancona</hi> (a Towne of the Popes Dominions) this muſt needes be vnderſtood in the third ſignification And therefore, to ſay that ſuch a Law is againſt the Church, is an <hi>Equiuocation.</hi> In like ſort where he ſaith, that the Pope ought not to ſuffer Chriſtian Princes to make lawes that may hurt or hinder the ſaluation of mens ſoules, we will put him in remembrance, that it is Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne doctrine,
<pb facs="tcp:17244:14"/>
That eccleſiaſticall perſons haue their exemption in criminall cauſes, onely <hi>iure humane:</hi> be it eyther by the graunt of Princes, or by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Popes, or by both together. Hereupon I would aske this queſtion; whether before ſuch graunts and conſtitutions were made, ſecular magiſtrates which puniſhed the offences of Clergy men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any ſin, or did any wrong to the Church? If it be ſaid they did, it cannot be maintayned: for they neither brake any lawe of God, as both himſelfe, and other truly hold: nor any law of man; for there was then no ſuch lawe made, <hi>et vbi non eſt lex, nec preuaricatio</hi> therfore it was no ſin: It was not againſt the ſaluation of mens ſoules, it was no wrong or preiudice to any man, why then could not the <hi>Popes</hi> ſuffer it ſo to continue? But the Author will ſay, it was ſo then (Perhaps) for there was no lawe yet to the contrary. But now the lawe is made, it is ſo no longer. Then ſay I, they haue ſtopped and ſtraightned the way to heauen, without them it would haue beene more eaſie, and therefore this they haue done, is not to edification. If it were once law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Princes, by puniſhing ſuch eccleſiaſticall perſons as did offend, to maintaine the publicke peace of their ſtates, and to giue ſatisfaction to the parties grieued, without committing any ſinne themſelues: what neede was it, or to what purpoſe; to inuent this deuiſe, ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the common good, and ſo likely to breede confuſion in all eſtates, whereby the puniſhing of malefactors, which is agreeable to the law of God, ſhall now become ſinne to them that doe it? Can this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile any thing to make the way of eternall ſaluation more eaſie? Can it bee for the good of wicked clergy-men themſelues, who take the more liberty and boldnes hereby to doe euill? Can it bee of any vſe in reſpect of them that are iniured? or do they not rather by this occaſion conceiue the deeper malice, and practiſe priuate reuenge? Do the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reape any good by it, whoſe ſtates and gouernments are diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and diſturbed thereby? Or can it bee any credyt or reputation to ſuch Clergy men, as are good and vertuous, that the lewde ſhould continue amongſt them? Is God honoured and glorified by any but ſuch as bee obedient to his lawes? But here I foreſee an obiection. that by this opinion, I ſeeme to diſlike all thoſe immunities and exemptions, which ſo many <hi>Princes,</hi> worthy of euerlaſting memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, haue graunted to the Clergye in Criminall cauſes. No, I am ſo farre from diſliking them, as I doe much commend them, and propoſe them as worthy patterns to be followed by all Princes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:17244:15"/>
and to come. But this is that which I ſay. That if wee beginne at <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, and goe along to <hi>Constantine</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Irene,</hi> and from him, through all the greeke Emperours, vntill the finall deſtruction of that Empire, and among the Latines, from <hi>Charles</hi> the great, to <hi>Fridericke</hi> the ſecond, <hi>incluſiue,</hi> wee ſhall not finde, that any Prince did euer exempt the Clergy from his owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. But all the exemptions they graunted, were from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour offiicers and Magiſtrates; ſome from all, and other from ſome onely. And ſome, in certaine kindes of offences, and other in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiuely. But there remayned ſtill vnto the Princes themſelues that ſupreame authority which could not bee ſeuered from them. Now ſo as offences be puniſhed, to what Magiſtrate it ſhall belong to doe it, and to what not, and ouer what perſons hee ſhall haue authority, and ouer whom hee ſhall not, it belongs to the Prince to appoint, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the congruety and fitneſſe of tymes, places, and matters. And accordingly wee ſee, that when the ſtate of their affaires ſo requires it, Princes doe ſometimes graunt priuiledges and exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto ſouldiors, and ſometimes to men of other conditions. In like ſorte, when it is requiſite for the planting or propagating of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in their dominions, they are content to giue conuenient pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges and exemptions to eccleſiaſticall perſons: and therein they deſerue to bee much commended, as I doe highly commend all tha forenamed Princes, and likewiſe the common wealth of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> which though not by a written lawe, yet by a laudable vſe and practiſe, hath exempted <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> perſons from the ordinary Magiſtrate in ordinary crimes, and ſuch as cary no enormity with them. But for ſuch a Lawe, as ſhall take away from a Prince all authority to puniſh offences, euen when the neceſſitie and peace of his ſtate doth require it, I doe not ſee how any man can eyther allowe it, or account it agreeable to the lawe of GOD or nature. It followeth not therefore. that becauſe wee commend many holy priuiledges which Princes haue graunted in this kinde, wee muſt of neceſſitie commend alſo an exorbitant exemption, which tends ſo directly to the confuſion and generall diſturbance of the ſtate. Therefore let vs conclude, that it is true, that the <hi>Pope</hi> neither can, nor ought to giue permiſſion or allowance of any of thoſe thinges, which in their owne nature are euill and oppoſite to the ſaluation of mens ſoules, and which, though hee ſhould permitte them, would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17244:15"/>
neuertheleſſe continue to bee ſinnes, and exclude him that doth them from attaining ſaluation. And ſurely thoſe Popes are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of exceeding praiſe, that haue indeauored to remooue ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, and other things forbidden by God, which remayning, make it impoſſible for men to bee ſaued: Theſe many yeares, the worlde hath ſighed and groaned for ſuch a reformation: and ſo many a time haue they beene deceiued and diſappointed of their hopes. But in thoſe things which are not repugnant vnto the will of God, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces liberty ought to be reſerued vnto him; to doe that which the good and weale of his ſtate requires. And if the Pope go about to debarre him of this, hee ſhall vſurpe temporall authority, contrary to Chriſts commandement, hitherto the Author hath maintayned this diſpute in ſome friendly manner, but in the ſecond place, by occaſion of theſe wordes of the tranſlators, where hee ſaith, that hee had bent his ſtudie and indeauour, to finde out, what force and validity excommunications cary, when they are denounced vppon ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt cauſes, hee falles very fiercely and violently vppon him, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Surely in reading well ouer againe the tranſlators words I cannot finde that he doth abſolutely define that the Popes ſentence is vniuſt,<note place="margin">Fryer Paulo,</note> for in a Parentheſis he hath theſe wodrs (which ſeemes to mee neither reaſonable nor credible) which parentheſis the Author hath purpoſely omitted. But admit that there were no ſuch parentheſis, and let vs take his bare words without it. A report being ſpread, that the Common wealth was excommunicated for refuſing to yeelde or giue away her liberty, I haue laboured to finde out in approoued auctors &amp;c. Heere the tranſlator preſuppoſeth one thing as certaine: That an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication denounced againſt thoſe that ſhall refuſe to ſubiect their lawfull liberty, is vniuſt: and two other things remaine doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the one in law, to wit, what force ſuch an excommunication car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, the other in fact, whether this exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication now ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of be ſuch a one, as common fame had deliuered it to be. The latter point he could not gather by his ſtudie out of bookes, therefore he bent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſtudy the former. So it ſeemes that he doth not definitiuely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any thing as the Author affirmeth. If a man ſhould vſe ſuch a ſpeech as this: A common report being ſpred in Venice, that <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> Prince of Muſcouia with many of his followers was murthered, for ſuffering himſelfe to be led by the Ieſuites (and perſwaded) to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt diuers things againſt the lawes and orders of the ſtate: I haue bent my ſelfe to ſearch in approoued Authors, what puniſhment (thoſe) religious perſons are worthie of, which intermedle in matters of ſtate with the loſſe of many mens liues, and extreame danger to the common peace and quietneſſe of the ſtates they liue in: Could any man iuſtly ſay heere: This man pronounceth that the Ieſuits are diſturbers of the common peace? No truly. But in this ſentence, the point which is certaine and out of doubt, is this. That whoſoeuer doth diſturbe the common peace ſinneth: the two points in doubt, are, the one in law, which may be ſtudied out of bookes, to wit, what puniſhment a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17244:16"/>
perſon merits that doth ſo, the other in fact, what indeede fell out in <hi>Muſcouia:</hi> the certainetie whereof may be knowen in time. Such for all the world is this point, that we haue in hand. And I am verily perſwaded, that the Author in his iudgement thinkes the ſame. But to take the better occaſion and fitter ſcope to inuey againſt any man, that ſhould affirme this excommunication of the Popes to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, he makes a ſhew to beleeue that the tranſlator had ſaid ſo. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is wont to reprooue very ſharpely, ſuch as drawe and wreſt to a ſenſe of their owne framing, another mans words, to the end to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them. But in this particular, it fitted his purpoſe verie well, thus vnder a colour of confuting a perſon vnknowen, to raile vpon all them that withſtand the Popes Excommunication. Now if a man ſhould take occaſion of that which the Authour hath ſaid in the Text before alleadged, to wit, that the lawes of Venice are vniuſt and impious: returne vpon him his owne verie words, and tell him, that it is an vntruth coupled with &amp;c. to determine that the lawes of ſo great and worthie a Common-wealth, agreeing with the lawes of all Chriſtian Kingdomes, are vniuſt and impious; and that if a man might conferre with him, he would be found peraduenture to haue but little vnderſtanding of the matter, and ſhould by way of <hi>Interpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> or <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> direct his ſpeech thus vnto him: is it poſſible that you ſhould be ſo, &amp;c. as to preſume to pronounce the lawes to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, of ſo wiſe and religious ſtate, which hath mainetained and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned it ſelfe theſe 1200 yeares, to the great admiration and notable patterne of the whole world? eſpecially thoſe lawes not being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and peculiar onely to that ſtate, but receiued and admitted in all Chriſtian ſtates, and alſo accounted iuſt and ſo approoued by all, (but ſuch as are intereſſed) who are rather tranſported with paſſion, then guided by reaſon. The Author could not much complaine, being but fettered with his own gieues, and reprooued with his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per termes. But we will forbeare to vſe any ſuch formes of writing. Yet this I will be bold to adde: That if any man writing of the preſent occurrents and affaires of the world, ſhould deliuer his opinion that his Excommunication of the Pope were vniuſt, it were not ſo heynous or damnable a matter. For in reading the Chriſtian Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers, we ſhall finde infinite example of writers, that haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered their mindes freely of the decrees, commaundements, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Popes of their time, and of thoſe that liued before them.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17244:17"/>
And Indeed go no further then to that which all moderne writers haue reported of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, and <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond, and of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both of their ſucceſſors and predeceſſors; onely God hath this perfection, that he cannot erre, and to be vnreprooueable. All other ought to be verie carefull and heedfull of that which they, becauſe the good conceit and perſwaſion that the world may haue of their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wiſedome, may ſerue for a bridle, to reſtraine ſuch, as by the checke of their owne conſcience will not bee conteined within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of their dutie. But let vs goe on to the third obiection, where he ſaith thus.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note>
               <hi>Now followeth the third vntruth.</hi> And reading in the ſacred Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> thoſe words, worthy indeed to be written in letters of Gold. <hi>Although the weapons of Excommunication, &amp;c.</hi> I could haue wiſhed, that as thoſe holy Fathers haue preſcribed vnto all Prelates, a Rule which they are to obſerue, to make the vſe of that medicine profitable, where it is applied; ſo they would haue likewiſe inſtructed religious and deuout conſciences what their dutie is, in caſe that their Prelates ſhall denounce cenſures againſt them, contrarie to the forme preſcribed by our Sauiour Chriſt, by Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> and by the ancient ſacred Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. <hi>The tranſlator not contented to haue vtteted an vntruth against the Pope, addeth heere an other againſt the generall Counceil, and ſo wrongeth at once both the head and principall members of holy Church, he condemnes then the holy Councell of Trent of inſufficiency, in that, hauing giuing a rule vnto Prelates, not to vſe Excommunication in ſleight and friuolous cauſes; It did not alſo inſtruct lay men, how they ſhould carrie themſelues, when their Prelates obſerue not that rule being agreeable vnto the rule of Chriſt, of Saint</hi> Paule, <hi>and of the ancient holy Canons. But if he would haue read out the whole decree of that holy Councell, and not the firſt words onely, he ſhould haue found that which he makes ſhew to deſire, &amp; he would haue eaſily perceiued, how falſly &amp; wrongfully he doth attribute vnto that Councell, inſufficiencie of doctrine. The decree which he alleageth, is the third of the laſt Leſſon concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matter of reformation. And as in the beginning of the decree, Prelates are admoniſhed not to vſe the ſword of Excommunication, Temere &amp; leuibus de cauſis, that is, raſhly and for ſleight and friuolous cauſes, ſo in the end, a caueat is giuen to Lay men euen ſuch as are placed in publike offices of ciuill gouernment, that it belongs not vnto them, to iudge, whether the Prelate in his Excommunication, obſerue the due forme and courſe preſcribed or not. And therefore the Counſell commaundeth all ſeculer Magistrates, that they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17244:17"/>
preſume not to forbid or hinder the prelate from denouncing any excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, much leſſe command him to reuoke it, vnder colour that it is not done, orderly and according to the rule appointed. Nefas autem ſit ſaeculari cuilibet magiſtratui prohibere eccleſiaſtico iudici, ne quem excommunicet, aut manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vt latam excommunicationem reuocet, ſub praetextu, quod contenta in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenti decreto nun ſint obſeruata<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cum non ad ſeculares, ſed ad eccleſiaſticos haec cognitio pertineat: theſe are the words of the holy councell, which hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in prouided for euery thing, and taught vs, that the duty of ſeculer magiſtrates is, not to reſist with force and violence the publiſhing of excommunications, as the magiſtrates of the ſtate of</hi> Venice <hi>do at this day, abuſed and miſled by ſome men that are more ready, to flatter then to teach the truth: of which number this fellow is one, whom we are about to anſwere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he accuſeth <hi>Gerſons</hi> tranſlator of too things, the one that he chargeth the councell with inſufficiencie, the other that if he had read the reſt of the decree, and not onely the begining, he ſhould haue found that he ſought. To the firſt obiection I will anſwere breifly, becauſe the ſecond, carrieth me away from inſiſting vpon any other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is the very ſame argument that heretikes vſe againſt vs, for when we ſay, that traditions are neceſſarie, becauſe euery thing is not found expreſly in holy ſcripture; as for example: The croſſing with the ſigne of the croſſe, the adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Images, the inferior orders, the conſecration of Churches, and altars; they tell vs by and by that we make the ſcripture to be inſufficient. But indeede the ſcripture for all that can not be ſayd to be inſufficient, becauſe it contaynes all that which was conuenient and needfull to be written, and leaues the reſt to traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which it giueth good allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of. Thus doth Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwere very often the obiections of the heretikes. And ſo in this queſtion we muſt ſay: That the councell is not therfore to be holden inſufficient becauſe it deliuereth not all that ought to be knowen, touching exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, if it haue omitted ſome particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and referred them to be taught by catholike writers. And it is well knowen to euery man, with how many neceſſary declarations, <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> hath ſupplied ſome defects of that councell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the point of ſpirituall conſanguinity, of affinitie, by reaſon of fornication, and of publike honeſty. And the congregation of Cardinals doth dayly ſupply in ome other points, vnder the title of declarations. The councell is no to be accounted among Canonicall writers. But we are to thinke, that if it had continued longer, it would haue declared much more then
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17244:18"/>
it did, and the author ought not to ſpeake as he doth, being ſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the new conſtitution. <hi>De queſito de auxilijs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But heere perhaps ſome man will obiect, that <hi>Gerſons</hi> tranſlator hath then committed an error, in wiſhing that which the holy councell thought not expedient to doe. But it is not true, that it is alwaies euill, to wiſh that which one vncapable of ſinning euen by nature, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined otherwiſe: I wiſh that it had pleaſed god to haue permitted Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> the eight, to haue liued till theſe times: and I doe not ſinne in ſo wiſhing, and yet god thought it not expedient. But I know very well, that there be ſome, that will not be ſatiſfied, with the aſſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of ſuch a ſufficiencie onely vnto the Councell, as we haue ſpoken of; but they would gladly haue it to be ſuch &amp; ſo great, as ſhould be without any defect or imperfection: to the end that no man might ſay hereafter, that there is any more neede of a Councell. And in this point concerning the ſufficiencie of the decree, made touching cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, we ſhould haue beene freed of much labour, if as well the acts as the decrees of the councell had beene printed. To this day, if any acts of the Councell of <hi>Epheſus</hi> be found, which was at leaſt. 1200. yeares agoe, or of the Councell of <hi>Nice;</hi> which is more auncient: they are embraced and receaued with all greadineſſe. The acts of the holy Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> are extant, &amp; I leaue it to the authors great wiſedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to iudge, whether it were not good they were publiſhed. Sure I am that they would reſolue and cleare this doubt we haue in hand. To the ſecond obiection, I could haue wiſhed, that he which is ſo curious to finde faults in the tranſlation of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> would haue beene more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act &amp; faithfull in tranſlating the words of the Councell. The Councell ſaith: <hi>Nefas ſit ſeculaeri cuilibet magiſtratus.</hi> The author interprets it thus, let lay men take heed, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe which are placed in publicke authory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I ſuppoſe that any grammar ſcoller will expound, <hi>Saeculari cuilibet magiſtratui,</hi> for any ſecular magiſtrate, and not for lay men, euen thoſe which are placed in publike office; ſo that of priuat perſons there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpoken: but the tranſlator of <hi>Gerſon</hi> deſired inſtruction, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout and religious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, and not for magiſtrates: and the author hath added theſe words, lay men to include priuate perſons, contrary to the meaning of the Councell. Thoſe other words likewiſe. <hi>Sub prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textu quod contenta in praeſenti decreto non ſunt obſeruata,</hi> are not truely rendred by him in theſe words, vpon pretence that it is not done or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and according to the due forme: he ſhould haue ſayd thus, vpon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17244:18"/>
pretence that the things are not obſerued, which are contayned in this preſent decree, for there are many other due formes and rules in Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> which are not contayned in the decrees of that Councel. The Councell forbiddeth lay magiſtrates, that they ſhall not by their authority, commaund any excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is denounced, to be reuoked, vpon pretence that all things were not therein obſerued, that are contayned in that decree. But if ſome other things be omitted, which ought to be obſerued, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell doth not determine, whether in ſuch caſes, lay magiſtrates may commaund the cenſure to be reuoked. And peraduenture in ſome caſe they may, according as they vſe to doe in the Parliaments of <hi>France.</hi> It is euident therefore that the councell hath giuen no inſtruction to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute and religious conſciences, that is, to ſuch as are vniuſtly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and to them which liue among them, who are to conuerſe and communicate with them, what their duty is in that caſe, which is the point that <hi>Gerſons</hi> tranſlator deſired. But after the Author hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged the words of the councell. <hi>Nefas autem ſit ſaeculari cuilibet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistratui prohibere eccleſiaſtico Iudici ne quem excommunicet, aut mandare vt latam excommunicationem reuocet, ſub praetextu quod contenta in praeſenti decreto non ſint obſeruata, cum non ad ſeculares ſed eccleſiaſticos haec cognitio pertineat,</hi> thus he goeth on. Theſe are the words of the holy councell: which hath prouided for euery thing, and hath taught vs, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and duety of ſecular magiſtrates is, not to reſiſt with force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence the publiſhing of excommunications, as the magiſtrates of the common wealth of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> do at this time. Here I cannot chooſe but be much amaſed. The councell ſaith that the magiſtrate ought not either to forbid eccleſiaſticall Iudges to excommunicate, or to commaund them to reuoke their exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication when it is denounced. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſaith that it commaunds them not to reſiſt the publication of an excommunication with force. Theſe things are as different as heauen and earth, for the publication may be hindred, without either forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſentence of excommunication to be pronounced, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to bee reuoked when it is pronounced. The one is an act of power and iuriſdiction ouer him that doth excommunicate, the other an act of naturall defence, which requires no iuriſdiction at all, &amp; doth not only appertaine to magiſtrates, but to priuate men alſo: as wee may ſee in <hi>Caitan, Soto,</hi> and <hi>Victoria,</hi> who doe all intreat at large, of the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that both priuate men and ſecular magiſtrates, ought to make, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17244:19"/>
all vnlawfull commandements, &amp; eſpecially the <hi>Popes.</hi> And with them agreeth alſo Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his treatiſe <hi>de Romano Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> written in a time, when, this controuerſie not beeing as yet begun, he iudged without all paſſion and parciality, where then doth there appeare, or whence is there proued any ſuch vntruth, as the Author affirmeth that <hi>Gerſons</hi> tranſlator hath vttered againſt the counſell; and that other point, that if he had read out the whole decree, hee ſhould haue found &amp;c. So in concluſion, the obiection that is made againſt the tranſlator in this point, is grounded onely vpon three vntrue and improper interpretations made by the Author, contrary to the true ſenſe and words of the Councell. But let vs paſſe to the fourth point, where he ſaith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Author of this tranſlation proceedeth and ſaith. And whiles not finding that which I ſought for,</hi>

                  </gap>tc. It cannot be denyed, but Iohn Gerſon was a Doctor of very great learning and piety, but the vnhappines of thoſe times, by reaſon of the long continuance of the ſciſme in the Church of Rome, gaue occaſion to that Doctor, as well as to ſome other of that age, to thinke ſomewhat vnderfoote of the authority of the Apostolick ſeat. Becauſe that while they ſought by meanes of the generall Councell to remedie the ſciſme, &amp; to induce the Popes of ſeueral obediences to ſubmit their claimes &amp; pretenſions to the Councels decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; hereupon they ſet themſelues to intrance the authority of Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cells beyond meſure, &amp; as much to debaſe that of the ſupreme Biſhop. And hereupon it grew that they fell into manifeſt errors, contrary to the holy Scriptures, and to the generall iudgment of the diuines that haue beene before and ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Authority in thoſe matters which concerne the</hi> Popes <hi>power, is not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moment: and there were enow other writers more ſound, which might haue beene quoted, to giue vs to vnderſtand how farre the force of an excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation extends; as are Saint.

long continued exerciſe in teaching ſacred diuinity, and the things hee effected by his teaching, his example, and his publicke autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity withall, hee could hardly haue perſwaded his reader, that <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was a man likely to bee ſtirred by indiſcreet affections. But ſo powerfull is the will of contradiction, that it transporteth him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract not from <hi>Gerſon</hi> alone, but from the reſt of the Doctors of that age, and to taxe them as manifeſtly erronious, and ſuspected, and contrarie to the Scriptures. Wee cannot denie the vnhappineſſe of thoſe times, and the long durance of that ſciſme in the Romane Church; but withall wee muſt needes acknowledge a much greater infelicitie in theſe of ours, wherein ſo great Kingdomes haue made a totall ſeparation from the ſame Church: whereupon there is bred an appetite in ſome, to ſupply and make vp by an intenſiue way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement within thoſe few regions that remaine, all that was ſo loſt in extent and territory abroad: yea an infelicitie indeede may wee rightly tearme that of our times, when there is not that father of the auncient Church that is not cenſured, and when they dare take v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them to ſay, that if they had liued in theſe dayes, they would not haue ſpoken as they haue ſpoken. Neither is it to be beleeued, that the occaſions of thoſe times did transporte men more to fauour the authority of Counſells, more I ſay, nay or any thing ſo much, as the preſent occaſions transport ſome to depreſſe them: ſince it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that all the Kingdomes that are ſequeſtred from the Church, do deſire and grone after a Councell.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as in very deede to ſpeake in fauour of a Councell can not touch any one mans proper intereſt, ſince no one perſon can aſpire to become a Councell, whereof hee muſt bee content to be but a fiue hundreth parte: ſo as it is more to bee miſdoubted, the vnhappineſſe of the preſent times caries on an affectation of exceſſe, then that of the ages paſt, did of any diminution. A good zeale to cure ſciſme, ſuch as was that of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> and the reſt of that age by the Authors owne confeſſion, it is not wont to tranſport to any peruerſe opinion, ſpecially ſuch as are no way intereſſed; but this catiue zeale of inlarging ones own greatnes, is a perilous motiue to ſeduce into blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Here I muſt not omit to note, that it is a kinde of taxing of Gods prouidence, to ſay, that he ſuffered an age to fall into a manifeſt error &amp; contrary to the deuine ſcriptures, an age that was moued out of a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17244:20"/>
zeale, to reduce the holy Church to vnitie. Men of much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and godlines, ſuch as the Author confeſſeth, that <hi>Gerſon</hi> and the other moſt excellent Doctors of that age were, are not ſuffered to fall into ſuch errors; ſince to fall into open errors, repugnant to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is a defect ſo enormeous and exhorbitant, that by the Authors good leaue, I will auerre it, that who ſo falleth into it, hath no ſparke of either godlines or knowledg. To erre manifeſtly againſt the Scriptures is the greateſt blindneſſe that can happen to any Chriſtian, &amp; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt chaſticement that God can impoſe in puniſhment of him whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall make vſe of the deuine authority, to ſerue his owne turne in mondaine intereſts. It is too to groſe, &amp; expreſſe a contradicton, to be forced to confeſſe the great learning &amp; piety of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> and to ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that he fell into open errours, contrary to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>It is not as yet decided, who holds the better opinion touching the authority of the ſea apoſtolick, whether <hi>Gerſon,</hi> or our Author: that he ſhould preſume to pronounce it ſo abſolutely, that <hi>Gerſons</hi> authority in the queſtion of the <hi>Popes</hi> power is of no moment. Moment is a terme re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latiue, and that which is of no moment with him, is neuertheleſſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment with others: and if the Authors opinion be of value in any place, then that of <hi>Gerſons</hi> is eſteemed of in many more.</p>
            <p>But to leaue this apart; in all theſe twelue conſiderations the Author could find no fault, but at one only point, &amp; that propounded incide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the reſt of the doctrine he muſt needs allow, &amp; howſoeuer he ſtreines him ſelfe, what by limitations, what by extenſions, to make a ſhewe of the contrarie, yet in fine he approues all: ſo that in direct dealing, hee ought not to haue made this point of the ſuperioritie of general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels for his principall queſtion; ſince that is not the point now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, nor any man affects to make any ſuch vſe of that point, to drawe in his holineſſe purpoſely for his obiect; that it might beare any ſuch conſtruction, that the defence of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> were in offence of his holines.</p>
            <p>There wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted not (ſaith the Author) other writers more ſound, which might haue beene alledged, and he nameth Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> S. <hi>Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tura,</hi> S. <hi>Antonine</hi> in particular. But <hi>Gerſons</hi> doctrine, That excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations abuſiue and <hi>nulle</hi> are not to be feared; That we ought not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them, but defend our ſelues againſt them; That in caſes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full we ought to take aduiſe, and that all ought to be vnited to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, it is the doctrine of both S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and of S. <hi>Bonauentura,</hi> &amp; of S. <hi>Antonine,</hi> &amp; of infinit others more; but it is not indeed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pacted

all into one place, ſo as it may be ſeene vnder one view in one ſmall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat, as it is in this of <hi>Gerſons.</hi> He that will collect places out of theſe and out of their ſchollers, he ſhall finde their doctrine (I ſpeake not here of that head, touching the ſuperiority of the Councell, but of the reſt to be in all, and through all points conforme to that of <hi>Gerſons.</hi> Here I will adde this, that if the author ſhall proteſt vnto me, that he will admit of all S. <hi>Bonauentures</hi> doctrine, (who was a man of ſo great ſanctity and knowledge) I wil vndertake to produce him places, that ſhall giue him much more trauerſe, then <hi>Gerſon</hi> and thoſe other of his time haue done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wel he might haue forborn theſe terms of <hi>ſuſpected</hi> &amp; <hi>erronious,</hi> &amp; not haue aſcribed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to one, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe acknowledgeth for one of great learning &amp; religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p>
               <hi>But the cauſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note> 
               <hi>which induced the Author of the praeface to tranſlate and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh</hi> Gerſons <hi>two treatiſes, is moſt blame-worthy of all the reſt; To the end</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that euery godly and religious conſcience in reading them may take comfort, and not incurre that great iudgement which God ſends vpon the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, to conceiue a feare of thoſe things, which are not to be feared. Trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauerunt timore vbi non erat timor. Behold how farr mans blindneſſe aſpires to abuſe and miſapply the word of God, to take away the feare of God. The holy Prophet in the</hi> 13, <hi>and in the</hi> 52 <hi>Pſalme, he ſaith,</hi> The vngodly feare not the true God, who is moſt worthy to be feared: <hi>Non est timor dei ante oculos eorum</hi> and on the contrarie they feare their falſe Cods which haue no power all, <hi>Illic trepidauerant timore, vbi non erat timor. And now this new Doctor takes the words of the Pſalme in a cleane contrarie ſenſe going about to perſwade by them, that Gods Vicar is not to be feared, and conſequently that we ſhould not feare the true God himſelfe, ſince he hath ſaid it to his Vicars, Qui vos audit, me audit: qui vos ſpernit; me ſpernit.</hi> Luc. 10. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erie repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are the words of Saint</hi> Gregorie, <hi>to theſe of our new diuine. For he in his</hi> 26 <hi>Homily ſpeaking of excommunication ſaith, that the ſentence of the Paſtor is to be feared, be it iuſt, or vniuſt; and this man ſaith, that who ſo feareth the Pastors ſentence which he holdes to bee vniuſt, falles into that iudgement of the reprobate, which feare where no cauſe is. And the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe that growes out of this doctrine it ceaſeth not heere, but goes on, and ſpreads out further, euen to the vtter ruine of ſoules: for he that feares not the cenſures of the ſupreame Paſtor, much leſſe will he feare that of the Biſhops: and he that begins once to diſpiſe the orders of the head of the Church, will make ſmall conſcience of diſregarding any other order whatſoeuer. By this cunning,</hi> Martin Luther <hi>hath perſwaded many men, that Chriſtian liberty conſiſteth in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17244:21"/>
hauing a large conſcience, and in not fearing to tranſgreſſe all the orders of the Church: and hereupon haue we ſeene ſo many Monkes, and Nunnes without any ſcruple at all to abandon their Monaſteries, caſt away their ſacred habits, and take husbands &amp; wiues; and ſo many nations to trample vpon the holy Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to forget the feaſts, and feaſt euent, not to know any longer what is meant by Lent, Confeſſions, veſpers, and Maſſe: and finally we may ſee from this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of not fearing the authority of Chriſts vicar in earth, how ſome whole Prouinces are brought to that paſſe, that they haue no note or marke at all of any Chriſtian religion left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In conformitie with the Author we may here begin by exclamation, alwaies prouided it be not ſlanderous. Behold how farre the confidence of the great ones aſpires, and attributes that to a defect in others, which proceeded indeed from their owne greatnes. It is manifeſt of old to the whole world, and the ſtories are full of it, that the very beginning of the ſeparation that fell out ſome hundred years ſince in Germany, took not it originall from any diſobedience of the ſubiects, but out of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of power and greatnes in the Prelats. It is wel knowne that it grew out of in diſcreet extorſions, &amp; out of extrauagant faſhions of granting Indulgences: I truſt in God that theſe preſent alterations ſhall be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with the health &amp; ſafetie of the body that remaines intyre, &amp; not with the ruine &amp; perdition of it; and tell me for Gods ſake, whence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne theſe alterations, but becauſe they could not be contented that a few perſons in number (who if a man ſuruey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well, wil hardly make vp 1000) ſhould enioy a fourth part of the riches of the whole ſtate, which containes foure millions of perſons; and becauſe they would in-fine haue ſtripped all the Laitie out of their goods? And euen as they beganne, ſo haue they proceeded on, becauſe they would haue brought it to that paſſe, that ſome which haue nothing elſe but the bare name of Churchmen, might without feare of Iuſtice, vncontrolled offend other men both in their liues and honor. Admit now ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe had befallen vs, who ſhould haue beene in fault? but they that would haue innouated and changed the courſes of iudicature that haue beene vſed and eſtabliſhed theſe 1200. yeares paſt, and the lawes that tooke their beginning aboue 300 yeares ſince? It was not greatly to the purpoſe when the queſtion is made betweene Catholickes of the validitie, or nullitie of a Cenſure: to enter into Monaſteries, Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, Images, Feaſts and Feaſt-euens, Lents, Conſeſsions, Veſpers, Maſſes, and all to enforce other men to anſwere them, and lay open whence the miſchiefe growes: it had been much better to haue ſtood
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17244:21"/>
vpon the matter, &amp; treated of it as it comes to hand with charity, &amp; not to beare themſelues in hand, that the world is ſo ſimple, as not to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, whether this preſent difference be about a temporall matter, or a ſpirituall. Now to leaue theſe digreſſions, into which the Author hath withdrawen me, happily beſide the queſtion, let vs conſider of the ſtrength of the oppoſition he makes againſt the interpreter touching the meaning of the words in the Pſalme. And to begin with the very ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſition which the author himſelf giues them, which I will not note for falſe, but I wil grant him, that for that ſhort verſe alone it may paſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peraduenture quoted from ſome other expoſition: but he that will read ouer the whole Pſalme ſhall ſee that it ſuts not with the letter, and that the Interpretor hath cited it indeed in it own true and literall ſenſe according to the cleare light of Gods word. For the argument of the Pſalme, it is an affectionate complaint againſt the vngodly, or if you wil ſo call him, the Atheiſt, together with the conſolation he receiueth from ſeeing him puniſhed: and not againſt him that feares falſe gods. This is cleared by the very beginning: <hi>Dixit inſipiens in corde ſuo, non eſt Deus.</hi> Now to underſtand the fifth verſe, <hi>Deum non inuocarunt, illiuc trepidauerunt timore, vbi non erat timor,</hi> we muſt know that, <hi>Dei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocatio,</hi> in the diuine Scripture is often taken by a Senecdoche for the recognition and acknowledgement of God: whereupon the literall ſenſe is, they acknowledged not the true God, &amp; yet neuertheleſſe they feared things that were not to be feared: for as much as that is the ſpecial chaſtiſement which God laies vpon the wicked, that though he ſeeme free from all feare, yet he of himſelfe frames in his owne apprehenſion diuers &amp; contradictory conceits, which cauſe &amp; work in him an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant feare: ſo may we ſee ſome in antiquity, that denied the immortality of the ſoule, and yet were infinitly troubled with feare of infamy after death: &amp; others that denied prouidence, no leſſe apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiue of coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diuinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; other fanſies. This is the very literal ſenſe: let vs now ſee whether it was alleged to this purpoſe. There are ſom (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes in words that they know god, but deny him in their deeds. Theſe are they, that liuing at rando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> care not at al for Gods law; they wil not ſticke to murder many men, to violate many mariage beds, and of theſe wickedneſſes they will neuer repent, they will rob as much as they can finger, and conſume all their owne goods, and other mens: but when they are cited to the Eccleſiaſticall Court to pay a tieth, and there excommunicated, being now become vnable to pay it; they are more trauerſed and grieued at this, then at all their offences committed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17244:22"/>
againſt God. Heere we are to conceiue that Chriſt our Lord he inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted excommunication for a medicine, &amp; for a puniſhment; and that if it be inflicted on a man without his guilt, it is a leſſe euill or miſchief to him, then any the leaſt veniall ſin: and there is no diuine which holds not thus; and I note further that an excommunication thundred out for any other cauſe, then for ſin, and without his ſin againſt whom it is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, doth not preiudice a Chriſtian ſoule at all. Therefore of him that ſhall haue no reſpect to offend againſt the commandements of God, &amp; ſhall yet ſtand in feare of ſuch an excommunication, it may be rightly ſaid according to the Pſalms literal ſenſe, <hi>Trepidauerunt timore vbi no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erat timor.</hi> He that hath a ſerious intent to liue Chriſtianly, he wil be careful to obſerue the commandements of God, and of them whom God hath commanded that they ſhould be obeied after himſelfe, in the things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to their ſuperiority; to the Pope &amp; Prelats in things ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to the Prince in ciuill, to the father or maiſter in things Domeſticall (for ſo much as he obeyeth them all, becauſe God commands him, and for no cauſe elſe) but where this order is not preſerued, and Gods owne commandements not preferred before all the reſt, there God permits it for their puniſhment, that intollerable precepts ſhall be impoſed vpon their ſhoulders, to which indeed they are not bound, &amp; menaceth them with vaine puniſhments which they in like ſort are more afraid of, then of the true puniſhments threatned them by God himſelfe, much like a child that cries at his mothers threatning him with a skaring &amp; no reall chaſtiſement. But if liuelie reaſons ſhal find no ouerture nor way in the Authors conceit, to perſwade him that the place of the Pſalme, <hi>Trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerunt timore,</hi> is rightly alleged: yet me thinks he ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be ouer-ruled by <hi>Nauarra</hi> his authority, who alleages the ſame Text againſt ſuch as feare void excommunications. <hi>Super cap. Cum contigat: Rem.</hi> 2. <hi>Numero</hi> 14. <hi>&amp; Numero</hi> 13. He ſaith, that to feare the Cenſures that are void and nulle, it is <hi>Deum falſum pro vero colere.</hi> But our Author he ſaith, that who ſo feares not Gods Vicar, feares not God himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith to his vicars, <hi>Qui vos audit me audit.</hi> Lu. 10. As is to ſay that indiſcreet excommunications are not to be feared, were as much as to ſay, that God is not to be feared, nor his vicar: and that he that wil feare God, muſt ſtand bound to ſubiect himſelfe, euen to the indiſcretion of the Prelats to whom God hath giuen no power at all, further then it ſhall be accompanied with diſcretion. And me thinks it ſtands not with the wiſdome &amp; learning of ſo great a man to alleage ſcriptures in a moſt ſtrange, yea in a contrary ſenſe to it owne, albeit I am perſwaded that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17244:22"/>
he hath not onely read the place it ſelfe, but the whole chapter. There is no ſpeach there of any vicars, nor of the ſupreame Biſhops, but of the Preachers of Gods word, who if they ſhal preach the doctrin of Chriſt who ſo heareth them, heareth Chriſt, and he that deſpiſeth them, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſt. So ſaith S. <hi>Luke</hi> in his tenth alleaged by the Author, that Chriſt appointed other 72, and ſent them two &amp; two that they ſhould go before him into all places whither he was to go; &amp; he teacheth them how they ſhould go, and what they ſhould preach, &amp; what they ſhould do when they were not receiued nor heard; and in the concluſion of all this he ads, <hi>Qui vos audit, me audit.</hi> Here I would requeſt not them of iudgement onely, but euery man of ordinary vnderſtanding but to view the place. It is commonly receiued of old in all the expounders of the ſcripture, that the Pope he ſucceeds S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Biſhops the Apoſtles, and the Prieſts to the 72, wherof we haue not now to treat, further then this, that where Chriſt ſaith, to the 72. <hi>Qui vos audit,</hi> he ſpeaketh as a Preacher to all Preachers. here the Author may obiect, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among theſe the Pope is likewiſe comprehended. I admit no leſſe, touching the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Chriſts doctrine: but I will not allow him that impropriety of ſpeach, as to ſay, Chriſt ſaith to his vicars, <hi>Qui vos audit, me audit.</hi> For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hold that the Preacher ought not to haue a coactiue iuriſdiction, if the place, <hi>Qui vos audit,</hi> had ſtood alone by it ſelfe, and not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with the antecedents and conſequents (which demonſtate it to haue been ſpoken to the 72 as Preachers) would haue good ſhew for it, and ſo it hath if we will read it apart; but the holy ſcripture is to be read intire, and not by peecemeale. Neither is that ſaying of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> That the ſentence of the Paſtor is to be feared, though it be vniuſt, contrarie to that which <hi>Gerſons</hi> interpreter followes. For when S. <hi>Gregories</hi> words are, <hi>The ſentence of the Paſtor, though it be vniuſt. &amp;c.</hi> he preſuppoſeth that it is a ſentence; becauſe if it be not a ſentence, it cannot be an vniuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but a non ſentence. Such muſt that be that a lay man ſhall take v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him to giue in cauſes eccleſiaſticall, and an eccleſiaſticall perſon in lay cauſes: but that ſentence which is vniuſt, and yet to be feared, is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is either of a good intention, or when there are falſe informations in fact brought in, in which caſes it is both to be feared &amp; obſerued: but when it doth conteine an intollerable error, then it ought not indeede (as we will ſhew in place) to be proudly diſpiſed, but yet with a kinde of reuerence vnreceiued. This, which is the common receiued doctrine the Author hath paſt ouer in ſilence, &amp; to him it would be but needles to ſay any more: but ſome other body to whoſe hands this diſcourſe

Vigiles &amp;c. they require no further anſwer, ſithence the reſiſtance which the ſtate of Venice makes againſt the foreſaid precept, is not made, but meerely to preſerue the Maſſes, &amp; Veſpers, the Feaſts, and their Vigiles which ſome would take away, &amp; put the ſtate in hazard to inebriate, &amp; fill it ſelfe with ſome pernicious opinion. Some other men might heere ſay, that ſuch &amp; ſuch a kingdome in the age laſt paſt hath loſt the ſound religion by reaſon of ſcandales giuen them from Churchmen; &amp; indeed the famouſeſt and trueſt Hiſtorians affirme no leſſe. And if this ſtate did not at this preſent out of it owne piety vſe all diligence to preſerue the religion, but ſhould be earneſt to put the Popes words in execution (I will not ſay his meaning, ſot I hope it is exceeding good) it would for truth be vtterly ouerthrowen with an extream downfal.

The Apostle in the Epiſtle to the</hi> Epheſians, <hi>the laſt chapter ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the reſiſtance which the faithfull are to make againſt the infernall diuell: Vt poſsitis ſtare contra incidias diaboli,</hi> And a little after; <hi>In omnibus iumentis ſcutu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fidei, in quo poſsitis omnia tela nequiſsimi ignea extinguere.</hi> As alſo ſaith S. <hi>Peter, Cui reſistite fortes in fide.</hi> and S. <hi>Iames, Reſiſtite Diabolo &amp; fugiet à vobis. And this new diuine applies this reſiſtance to the cenſures of the ſupreme Biſhop, as if the Apostle in ſtead of ſaying, Arme your ſelfe with faith, and with the word of God to reſiſt the diuell, had ſaid, Arme your ſelues with faith, and with the word of God to reſiſt god in his vicar. And what faith is that, or what word of God, that teaches to reſist Gods vicar? Nay what manner of faith is it, or what word of God, which doth not teach vs to be ſubiect and to obey the Prelats of the holy Church: ſaith not S.</hi> Paule <hi>in the</hi> 13 <hi>chapter of the Epiſtle to the</hi> Hebrewes: <hi>Obedite praepoſitis veſtris, &amp; ſubiacete eis? Saith not Chriſt himſelf, Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Si eccleſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non audierit, ſit tibi ſicut Ethnicus &amp; publicanus?</hi>

            <p>Indeed the Author alleageth S. <hi>Pauls</hi> text in it right ſenſe, but yet not in a contrary ſenſe to that to which <hi>Gerſons</hi> interpreter did apply it. S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſpake in generall againſt the aſſaults of the diuell;<note place="margin">Frier Paulo.</note> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter vnderſtands it, that indiſcreet excommunications are one kind of the aſſaults of the diuell: and it ſhould be a contradiction to terme them indiſcreet excommunications, and not to hold withall that they proceed from the diuel. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Omnis qui facit peccatumex dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolo eſt:</hi> And I beleeue this to be a moſt Catholik &amp; holy poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that an excommunication thundred forth againſt him that doth well, and that obeyeth Gods commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, hath it original from the diuels perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and it is one ſort of thoſe inſidiations which he practiſeth againſt the faithfull. The Author knows it, that we haue not to combat with the diuell in fleſh &amp; bones. All that whatſoeuer tends to the deſtruction of the ſpiritual ſtate of the Church, which is the kingdom of chriſt, it is the work of the diuel; &amp; if it be ſecret, it is an inſidiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; of all works that are wrought to the Churches detrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whoſe doing ſoeuer they be, the ſcripture makes the diuel the author, as indeed he is, thogh he do not put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by himſelf: the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many Churches, &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others by reaſon of theſe indiſcret exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munications make proof, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> the diuel lies in wait to ſuppla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t chriſts flock eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſame
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17244:24"/>
meanes, which Chriſt inſtituted to preſerue it. When S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith to the Theſſalonians that the diuel had often hindred him from comming to them, he doth not meane that this was otherwiſe done, then by the actions of men. The diuell he practiſeth &amp; imployeth all ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to this end, &amp; then not alwaies out of malice, but out of error; and who thinking to do well with an indifferent zeale do but execute his wicked inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions, &amp; the holy ſcriptures tel vs expreſly, that theſe &amp; ſuch like are the diuels own deeds. We may read it in S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> how after S. <hi>Peter</hi> had confeſſed our Lord to be the ſon of God, &amp; that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him the keyes of the kingdome of heauen; how he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded his diſciples not to make it knowen to any that he was the Chriſt, for that it behoued him to ſuffer &amp; to die in Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then S. <hi>Peter</hi> reproued him ſaying, <hi>Abſit à te domine, non erit hoc tibi.</hi> But our Lord turned back and ſaid to <hi>Peter, Vade poſt me ſatanae ſcandalum es mihi, quia non ſapis ea quae dei ſunt ſed ea quae hominum.</hi> Who wil make any doubt, that S. <hi>Peters</hi> zeal had not a good meaning, &amp; that it ſprang not from a good affection? Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he went about to hinder, as much as in him lay, the worke of our redemption, &amp; the edification of the Church, which was to iſſue forth of the ſide of Chriſt opened vpon the croſſe, Chriſt cals him Satan. Now it is no inconuenience to hold, that if S. <hi>Peter,</hi> through wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of foreſight, &amp; well deſerning what he did, dealt in a matter with a good intent, yet to the deſtruction of the Church; that, I ſay, it may yet alſo fall out that a ſucceſſor of his, not being ſo well aduiſed as were fit, may attempt that thing, bearing himſelfe in hand that he doth right well, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man that is neerer concerned in the fact, &amp; therefore can iudge better what it imports than he, may ſee clearly that it muſt needs ſort to the Churches vndoing. The Author is (I confeſſe) a man moſt excellent in learning, &amp; of ſingular efficacy in perſwading, yet for all this, he ſhall neuer make me beleeue, nor happily any other that ſhal read, how that euery mortall man of what place or dignity ſoeuer, may not ſometimes either through his owne will, or through humane infirmity, giue an aid &amp; furtherance, yet without any wicked intent in himſelf, to ſome ſubtile deſigne of the diuels: and from this ſcape let him neuer ſtrain himſelf to exempt any one man, vntill he ſhall haue exempted me him firſt from praying, <hi>Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.</hi> The Author demaunds, what faith is that, which teacheth to reſiſt Gods vicar? I anſwer him, it is the very faith of my L. Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who ſaith in formall tearmes thus. <hi>Ita<expan>

            <p>The Author alleageth that of S. <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews, Obedite praepoſitis veſtris, &amp; ſubiacete eis,</hi> and it likes me very wel; firſt becauſe it is not ment of the Pope in ſpeciall, but of the Biſhops, yea and of all Curats, ſo that it makes nothing for the Pope in particular; but he ſhuld indeed haue pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duced the whol place of S. <hi>Paul, Obedite praepoſitis veſtris, et ſubiacete eis: ipſi enim peruigila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; quaſi ratione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro animabus veſtris reddituri,</hi> or as he ſaith in the Greeke, Obey them that are ſet ouer you, &amp; be ſubiect vnto them for they ward ouer your ſoules, as they that muſt render an account of them. So farre forth as thoſe that are ſet ouer our ſoules, ſo farre it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines vs to obey them; which is as if he ſhould haue ſaid, wee muſt obeye them in thinges Spirituall, which appertaine to our ſoules health; and becauſe the Author brings in that <hi>ſi eccleſiam non audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſit tibi ſicut ethnicus &amp; publicanus;</hi> we muſt know that the Church is, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſtiles it, the pillar and baſis of the truth, and that it wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer teach any thing but the Doctrine of Chriſt, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund any thing but what ſhall be conforme to that; but wee haue not yet perceiued that the Church commandeth that which the Author ſaith: Se here our paralogiſme, which anſweres from our taking the name of Church, in diuerſe ſignifications. In this very place, many writers doe vnderſtand <hi>dic Eccleſiae, id eſt Praelatis Eccleſiae,</hi> but no one vnderſtands it of the <hi>Pope</hi> alone; we will vnderſtand it then of him indifferently as of all other Prelates, &amp; not in any manner of ſpeciallity, reſeruing notwithſtanding to euery one his owne degree &amp; place. And this, <hi>ſi eccleſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non audierit,</hi> ſhall be vnderſtood, when they ſhall ſpeake in the miniſtry of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, according to the doctrine of the Church. Now it is notorious that the proceedings of the Venetian ſtate, are according to the Church<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es doctrine, ſince the cuſtome &amp; vſe througout all Chriſtian Kingdoms are iuſt after the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>Here I would faine learne, why in that Goſpell, which is read vpon the tueſday after the third ſunday in Lent, where it was written in the Maſſe booke, <hi>Reſpiciens Ieſus in diſcipulos ſuos, dixit Simoni Petro ſi peccaue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit &amp;c.</hi> why they haue in all the Maſſebookes that haue beene printed of late yeares take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away theſe words? I know they are not in the books of the new Teſtament; but of many other words, which are found in the Maſſebooke, &amp; not in the bookes of the new Teſtament, it is ſaid they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17244:25"/>
come <hi>ex traditione Apostolica;</hi> &amp; ſo one will tell vs, that howſoeuer the Euangeliſt doth not affirme it, yet it comes by traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that theſe words were directed to <hi>Peter.</hi> Here then muſt needs grow ſome diſtinction by which there may appeare a difference betweene this tradition and the others; which when it is made, yet all will be to little to take order, that for many hundred yeares it was not ſo read, &amp; conſequently ſo belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all the faithfull for ſo many ages, that it was ſpoken particularly to <hi>Peter, dic eccleſiae.</hi> So that wee muſt needs aequiuocate in the noune Church, &amp; interpret it, <hi>dic tibi ipſi</hi> ye &amp; yet further it will be a ſenſe too to wreſted, to vnderſtand by (the Church) one ſole perſon, and that not ſo much becauſe the nowne it ſelfe brookes it not, as for that Chriſt himſelfe interpreting it in the words immediately following ſaith, <hi>vbi fuerint duo vel tres, &amp;c.</hi> So that it is apparantly cleared, that hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Church, a congregation of two or three at the leaſt, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his name: but of this, becauſe it is borne out by Saint <hi>Chriſostome</hi> expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we will ſpeak hereafter, where the Aut. alſo treats the matter more at large, &amp; ſhew him how S. <hi>Chriſo.</hi> is not for him, but is oppoſit.</p>

               <hi>But it is now time, we come to conſider of Gerſons conſiderations, &amp; to make it cleare that either they make nothing to the purpoſe, or that they are erroneus</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Frier Paulo.</note>Here before I proceede, to the particular defence of <hi>Gerſons</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, I muſt not ouerſlip to admoniſh the godly reader, that it is a trick of arte, or a deſſeine of the Author, for ſome of his owne ends, that he neuer leaues repeating &amp; iterating (aſwell in the matters we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſurueyed, as in thoſe that follow) &amp; charging the Venitian ſtate, that it will not acknowledge, it will not obey, that it deſpiſeth the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Biſhop, the vicar of Chriſt, and with other like tearmes apt to raiſe enuie, &amp; ingender hatred in ſo many as ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be rightly informed touching the controuerſie now a foote, and of the iuſtice of the ſttates cauſe; which end that it may more eaſily be obtayned, we may obſerue how they hinder it all they can that the reaſons of the State may not be ſeene; a practiſe directly againſt all reaſon, diuine and humaine. To which I wil ſay once for al, the ſo many inculcatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ingeminated by the Author, that this is not to handle the matter in queſtion with ſyncerity. For that the <hi>

               </hi> ſtate doth acknowledge &amp; obey (as it hath alwaies done) the holy Apoſtolick ſea neither doth it introduce any nouelty, but conſerues &amp; defends with all godlineſſe &amp; religion, the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick faith, which it prefers before all humane reſpects whatſoeuer; but onely in cauſes temporal, where the <hi>Pope,</hi> either for not beeing well informed, or through other bodies counſells, or for ſome other cauſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17244:25"/>
doth thunder out his cenſures notoriouſly againſt all iuſtice, they inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d within the bounds of the Catholick religion to maintaine their owne liberty, &amp; the authority giuen them from God, it beeing conforme to the lawes of God, &amp; nature, &amp; according to the doctrine of the godly &amp; catholick doctors. But now whether <hi>Gerſons</hi> conſiderations make or make not to the purpoſe, &amp; whether they be erroneous or not, let vs peruſe them euery one a part, as the Author ſhall preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt conſideration is, that excommunication &amp; irregularitie are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded principally vpon a contempt of the keyes of the Church, that is to ſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gerſon.</note> 
               <hi>of the Eccleſiaſticall authority. This conſideration is true, ſo you vnderstand by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, diſobedience; or if you wil ſo terme it, contumacie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; it is not contrary to our Lords practiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>The ſecond conſideration is, that the contempt of the keyes may be in three ſorts, directly, or indirectly, or appearingly, as the interpreter miſtranſlates it. For</hi> Gerſon <hi>expreſſes not his third ſort, with the word apparenter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gerſon.</note> 
               <hi>but with the word interpretatiue, which two words are in a manner quite contrarie For Apparens is that which appeares or ſeemes to be, and is not; and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiuum is that which ſeemes not, and yet is. But this ſcape little imports the matter in hand. For the firſt conſideration ſince he allowes it for true, I ſhall not neede to defend it, or adde any thing elſe vnto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond conſideration he admits likewiſe for true and reproues not <hi>Gerſon,</hi> but onely the traſlation. And in deede the interpreter ſhold haue ſtood greatly bound to him for his inſtruction, if hee had not troubled and confounded all with an aequiuocation. True it is, that ſometimes <hi>Interpretatiue</hi> ſignifies that which is, &amp; appeares not; and ſome times it ſignifies as much as <hi>tacite</hi> &amp; implies that which is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt but needs interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; is not oppoſite to the worde <hi>(vere)</hi> but to the word expreſly: in this ſenſe we call it <hi>licentia interpretatiua,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>tacita non expreſſa.</hi> But otherwhiles it ſignifies alſo that which ſeemes, &amp; is not; as when we ſay, not to ſalute a man, is <hi>interpretatiue</hi> a kinde of diſdaine; that is as much as it ſeemes a diſdenie, but peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is not: &amp; here interpretatiue, is oppoſit to <hi>vere.</hi> I can not tell what edition of <hi>Gerſon</hi> the Author hath, but in mine which was printed in the yeare 494; in the very end of this conſideration, his formal words are; <hi>Et iſto modo reperit contemptus in omni peccato, praeſertim mortali, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectiue, vel indirecte; vere, vel interpretatiue,</hi> If then <hi>vere</hi> be oppoſed to <hi>interpretatiue;</hi> then cannot <hi>interpretatinum</hi> be that which appeares not but yet is; becauſe that which appeares not, but is in it ſelfe, is <hi>verum.</hi> And if this ſuffice to cleare the Tranſlators integrity; I will yet adde
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17244:26"/>
that <hi>Gerſon</hi> in his third conſideration ſayth, that a conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the third ſort, which is <hi>contemptus interpretatiuus,</hi> doth not alwaies deſerue the Churches excommunication: if it deſerues not excommunication al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies; ergo it deſerues it ſometimes; but that which is, and appeares not, can not be ſubiect in any ſort to the Churches cenſures, as all the diuines &amp; <hi>Canoniſts</hi> affirme; therefore <hi>interpretatiuum</hi> is not that, which appeares not, and yet is. I hope well that the Author will now reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for this point, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly that his obiection of miſtranſlating made againſt the Interpretor is auoyded; which when I firſt read in the Authors proeme, I expected that in further reading I ſhould haue found many more places taxed for infidility &amp; miſinterpretation; but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had done reading ouer all, I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no one word ſo noted but this alone, &amp; that with this additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But this ſcape little imports the matter in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Me thought it ſtrange, that a man ſhould be noted as an vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full one, for one poore word, &amp; that of little importance, &amp; that in the very noting &amp; taxing it, the Author ſhould, ſerue his turne with an aequiuocall word, which in the very ſame place is explaned by <hi>Gerſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note>3 <hi>The third conſideration is, That the contempt of the keyes in the firſt and ſecond kindes do iuſtly deſerue excommunication, and by conſequence irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie: but that of the third kinde, doth not alwaies deſerue excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from the Church, but from God becauſe he that ſinneth mortally is exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by God. In this conſideration there is nothing much amiſſe, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the laſt words; for if a man will ſpeake properly of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is not true, that euery one that committs a mortall ſin is exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by God.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Frier Paolo.</note>In the third conſideration it is apparant, that an inordinate affection to finde fault, doth tranſport a man no leſſe then any other affection whatſoeuer; Since he doth not reprehend <hi>Gerſon,</hi> for that which is here concluded, which he allowes all for true; but faſtning vpon one word ſpoken immediately, he charges him to haue ſpoken amiſſe, for ſaying that who ſo ſinnes mortally is excommunicated of God, &amp; his reaſon is that this cannot be true if we ſpeake properly of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that then ſinners could not come to Maſſe, without ſinning anew Now I affirme againſt him, that it is a proper ſpeach to ſay that euery ſinner is exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated of god, becauſe exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication is a generall word, which imports all ſeperation from the communion of Saints; but there be two communions of Chriſtians, one internall in caritie with God and with the Saints, and this is properly the communion of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17244:26"/>
Saints, either for a ſeparation or priuation, for this is the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per excommunication; another communion there is betwixt the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church militant, which doth not ſo neceſſarily exact chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; &amp; to this communion we oppoſe that excommunication, which is the cenſure eccleſiaſticall; &amp; auoiding to this kinde of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euery ſinner is not excommunicate, and may therefore repaire to the Maſſe, it beeing a matter which doth not ſo neceſſarily require cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Now <hi>Gerſon</hi> neuer ſaid that he was excommunicated by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which is the churches cenſure. S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> 12, <hi>de Gen. ad literam. cap.</hi> 40 vſeth the ſame faſhion of ſpeech, <hi>Adam ab eſu ligni vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatus fuit. &amp; Gratianus, cauſa</hi> 11. <hi>Quaestione</hi> 3. after the Chap. <hi>Ad menſam,</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>ſcilicet &amp; Adam ab eſu ligni vitae excommunicatus est:</hi> and after the Chapter <hi>Non ſolum,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>quia ex natu adulterij ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu apud deum excommunicatus fuerat,</hi> which is iuſt according to <hi>Gerſons</hi> words. And againe how will you terme excommunication in Greeke but <hi>Anathema?</hi> yea our Diuines make no difference betweene <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication maior,</hi> &amp; <hi>Anathma.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>cupiebam Anathema eſſe a Chriſto</hi> and in annother place, <hi>ſi quis non amat dominum noſtrum Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum Chriſtum ſit Anathema.</hi> Now let him on that liſts, to finde fault with S. <hi>Paule,</hi> and ſay he ſpake improperly, ſithence euery ſinner <hi>Non amat dominum Ieſum,</hi> &amp; therefore is <hi>Anathema</hi> to fauour ſuch; and after let him proceede to blame <hi>Gerſon</hi> for miſtaking. It needed not, iwis, admit there had beene ſome improprietie, when hee vnderſtood <hi>Gerſons</hi> true ſenſe, who ſpake not of that excommunication, which is the Church cenſure, when he accorded with him in ſubſtance, to ſtraine and force his words in matters of no moment. And this might haue ſufficed mee, but that my deſire was to ſhew by alleaging S. <hi>Auguſtine, Gratian</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> how the Author reprehends that, for which indeede <hi>Gerſon</hi> deſerues to be commended.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>The fourth conſideration is,</hi>

               <hi>that a man is not to be ſaid to contemne the keyes in any of the three kindes, when a Prelate doth manifeſtly, &amp; notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſe the power of the keyes.

            </p>
            <p>This conſideration might euen as well haue beene paſſed ouer by the Author, ſince he finds nothing to reprehend in it. The limitation hee brings in, that the manifeſt &amp; notorious abuſe of the keyes excuſeth the faithfull from contempt; where he ſaith that this is true if the abuſe be in points eſſentiall, it is ſuperfluous. Who makes any doubt that it is ſo meant? The very word abuſe imports no leſſe in it owne ſignification. But when the Author adds, that howſoeuer <hi>Gerſons</hi> doctrine is true, yet the interpretors inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion may be full of poyſon. This is nothing elſe but to fight againſt ſhadows, to oppoſe againſt that which may bee, and to wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle with ones owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectures. Is this S. <hi>Pauls</hi> precept, not to iudge our neighbor, till our Lord himſelfe ſhall come to reueale the ſecret of harts. Is this that charity, <hi>quae non cogitat malu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Gerſons</hi> doctrine is good, the interpreter hath not ſo much as applied it, he ſpeaks not a word; but <hi>Ger.</hi> he puts too nothing of his owne, &amp; yet it is obiected for all this that the interpretors inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion may be verie venemous. Admit there had been ſome word which might haue beene turned either to the right hand or to the left, yet it had beene the part of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charity to haue interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to the beſt: but to come to what may be, &amp; that purpoſely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, &amp; to giue a brand, this exceeds the bounds of that we ought to do. This poyſonous intention which may be in the interpretor, he explains ſaying, peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture his meaning is to beare the world in hand, that this exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication thundred by <hi>noſtro ſignore,</hi> is a notorious abuſe of the keyes, which indeed is contrarily a lawful &amp; moſt holy vſe of them, as might clearly be demonſtrated, if that were the point to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled. I for my part cannot tell what is meant to be handled, but ſure I am this is the very queſtion ſhould be handled, becauſe this is it, which is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trouerſy, &amp; which would determine the ſtrife, &amp; without which it can not be determined. And of this I would faine the Author he had intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; laid aſide all other by-matters as little pertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">Gerſon.</note>5 <hi>The fift conſideration is, that when a prelate abuſeth the power of the keyes, he doth more disparage the keyes, &amp; offends more greuouſly then doth any man ſubiect to his iuriſdiction, when he obeyes not his prelate: &amp; hence it is gathered that it is a meritorious worke in ſuch like caſes, to reſiſt the prelate to his face as S.</hi> Paule <hi>did to S.</hi> Peter.<note place="margin">Bellarmine:</note> 
               <hi>In this conſideration much might be ſaid, but becauſe it makes little to our purpoſe, we will only ſay two things.

out, that ſometime the prelate that abuſeth his authority offends the more, and ſometimes the ſubiect that obaies it not: if we ſhall ſimply conſider the miſuſing of this power, &amp; the diſobeying of this power, it is a greater ſinne wilfully not to obay, then it is to vſe this power amiſſe: for he that abuſeth this power, commits but a ſinne of iniustice, &amp; offends a man ſubiect to him; but he that will not obey the prelate that commands iuſtly, &amp; deſpiſeth his excommunication, commits a ſinne of rebellion, &amp; offends Gods diuine Ma. in his Vicar: and ſo ſaith Chriſt, Qui vos ſpernit, me ſpernit.</hi> Luck. 10. <hi>and the Apoſtle in the firſt to the</hi> Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians <hi>the fourth chapter, Qui haec ſpernit, non hominem ſpernit ſed Deum.

            </p>
            <p>To that which were here to be ſaid, &amp; is not ſaid by the Author, I can make no anſwere, neither ought I to diuine, &amp; ſin in raſh iudgmet. Two things he oppoſeth.

The Author ſhall neuer find any Diuine, that when he is to compare two ſins, to finde out the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that will do it <hi>ex circumſtantijs,</hi> but only <hi>ex genere.</hi> The conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ex circumſtantijs</hi> is infinit, &amp; no wiſe man will pitch &amp; inſiſt vpon that which may varie <hi>in infinitum.</hi> And S.

Manſlaughter is worſe then theft: yet a manſlaughter may haue ſuch circumſtances to extenuate it, and a theefe, ſuch to agrauate it, that the theft ſhall be the greater ſinne. He that ſhall hold this Authors doctrine for ſound, ſhall neuer bee able to make compariſon betwixt two ſins. And yet for all this <hi>Gerſon</hi> hath declared himſelfe, that hee meant not to compare them <hi>ex circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantijs,</hi> but <hi>ex genere,</hi> ſince hee ſaith it, making the compariſon onely in the abuſe. Surely the Author marked not theſe words, for then he would neuer haue made this obiection.

And he brings his reaſon, becauſe he that abuſeth this power, offends but a man ſubiect to him, but he that wil not obey the Prelate that commands iuſtly, and

               <hi>deſpiſeth his excommunication, commits a ſinne of rebellion, and offends Gods</hi> Ma. <hi>in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar, becauſe of qui vos ſpernit, me ſpernit &amp;c. Et qui haec ſpernit non hominem ſpernit, ſed Deum;</hi> &amp; <hi>Samuel</hi> tearmeth this deſpiſing of God in his Vicar, a kinde of Idolatre.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the other, one void of paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing ſlept in the Lord now boue 150 yeares; the other a man yet liuing, &amp; a partie ſided in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie. Let vs therfore examine both their reaſons, &amp; 1. theſe of this Author. The words <hi>qui vos ſpernit, me ſpernit,</hi> we haue ſhewed before that they were ſpoken to the Preachers, which publiſh Chriſts doctrine. It may pleaſe the reader to peruſe what we wrote in that place, &amp; he will reſt ſufficiently informed of their meaning. But let him ad this withall, that at the day of iudgement, Chriſt will ſay to the reprobate, <hi>Quandiu non feciſtis vni de minoribus his, nec mihi feciſtis.</hi> So that there is aſwell au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture to ſhew, that Chriſt takes it for an iniury done to himſelfe, that is done to any of his faithfull: and this ſaying of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the Goſpell, <hi>Quandiu non fecistis,</hi> is not alleadged forth of it own literall ſenſe, for that admonition &amp; correction is indeede a worke of charity; as on the contrary, <hi>cum autoritate imperare, &amp; cum potentia,</hi> is againſt charity. That of S. Paul, <hi>Qui haec ſpernit non hominem ſpernit, ſed deum,</hi> I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee how it is cited any thing to the purpoſe, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>qui haec spernit,</hi> he ſpeakes of the things there ſpoken by himſelf, &amp; how then can it now be applied to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of the Prelate? S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the Theſſalonians to labour &amp; proceed according to the leſſons of God; ye know, ſaith he, what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements we haue giuen you from the Lord Ieſus, &amp; he names them, viz. that they ſhould bee cleane, they ſhould fly fornication &amp; deceiuing their neighbors, &amp; hee concludes, <hi>Qui haec ſpernit, non homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpernit, ſed deu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, qui etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dedit ſpiritum ſanctu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in nobis.</hi> Euery man will plainly vnderſtand out of S. <hi>Paules owne</hi> words, that his meaning was this God hath commanded ſuch and ſuch things, &amp; I haue intimated you his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth god, who hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me the holy ſpirit, to intimat his preceps vnto you. Let vs now make the applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our matters in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, thogh it be not here written downe, &amp; concluded withall, that when the <hi>Pepe</hi> ſhall intimate Gods owne precepts, he may ſubioyne, <hi>Qui haec ſpernit, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hominem ſpernit, ſed deum.</hi> But ſurely to equall any one man of this age, to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and a decree of what perſon ſoeuer to a canonicall ſcripture, I doubt how reaſonable it will be thought by any godly conſcience. S. <hi>Paul</hi> penning a canonicall Scripture, &amp; hauing an aſſured faith, that God aſſiſted him in that very particular, to the end he ſhould not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17244:28"/>
any the leaſt error, he might freely ſay, <hi>Qui haec ſpernit, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, ſed deum;</hi> but a man that will not ſay, he hath the aſſiſtance of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt for certaine, ſauing only when he doth determine a matter <hi>de fide ex cathedra,</hi> he cannot freely in a decree, which is not in a matter of faith, ſay, <hi>Qui haec ſpernit non homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpernit ſed deum.</hi> It is again a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe as great as the former, to cite for this purpoſe the ſaying of <hi>Samuel.</hi> 1. <hi>Regum.</hi> 15. <hi>Quaſi Peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ariolandi eſt repugnare</hi> &amp; <hi>quaſi ſcelus idololatriae nolle acquieſcere; Samuel</hi> as a prophet had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded <hi>Saul</hi> by Gods expreſſe precept, that he ſhould not leaue an <hi>Amalechite</hi> aliue, ye &amp; that he ſhould ſlay all their beaſts. <hi>Saul</hi> ſaued King <hi>Agag,</hi> and the heards of cattell to ſacrifice, <hi>Samuel</hi> tels him, how god would rather his precepts ſhould be obeyed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſacrifices ſhould be offered to him and that it was as the ſinne of Idolatry, not to reſt vpon his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. And will our <hi>Author</hi> now put a humane precept ſubiect to errours, into the ſame ballance with an expreſſe precept from God- which is of canonicall authority? Were there any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here that had, the authority of a Prophet, &amp; of a Canonicall writer, that ſhould denounce any thing in the name of god, <hi>Eſſet quaſi ſcelus Idololatria nolle acquieſcere;</hi> but religious eares cannot heare it with patience, that humane things ſhould in this faſhion be equalled with diuine. It is a dangerous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to match any man with God. It is a godly office to perſwade due obeyſance and reuerence vnto Prelats; but to extend it beyond it own bounds, and to value it equally with the Canonicall ſcriptures, this doth rather depreſſe it, then aduance it. Who can here conteine himſelf from extreme meruailing at the leaſt? <hi>Samuel</hi> 1100 years &amp; better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any Pope, ſaith that not to obey Gods expreſſe precept deuered by the mouth of his Prophet, is as it were Idolatry: our Author ſaith, To diſpiſe God in his vicar, is called by the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 15.) a kind of Idolotarie? Now I hope our Author will not denie that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was Gods firſt vicar; that in the old Teſtament God had no vicar; that the authority of a Prophet in the old Teſtament, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, yea euen in the leaſt things; that Chriſts vicar in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament he may erre, hauing in matters of of faith and of manners in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> How can the Author then, vnleſſe it be his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to dally &amp; ieſt with vs, ſay, that the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> termes this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſing of God in his vicar a kinde of Idolatrie? Among ſo many weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie matters I am drawen a little aſide to one lighter. Our Author tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth here: <hi>Quaſi ſcoelus Idololatriae,</hi> a kind of Idolatry, as if he ſhould tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>Nonaginta nouem ſunt quaſi centum,</hi> Nintie and nine are a kind of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17244:29"/>
hundreth. And this I had not noted, if he himſelf had not plaied the toto harſh Cenſor againſt <hi>Gerſons</hi> tranſlator, where he deſerued it not: but to returne to the ſenſe and meaning. Reader, behold his cunning; all ſins are againſt God; but ſome touch his diuine Maieſtie immediately, as the blaſpheming of his name, Idolatry, and ſuch like; other are againſt our neighbour immediately; &amp; for this cauſe againſt God, as are adultery, murther, &amp; theft: now of this latter ſort are both thoſe ſins we feare of. Diſobedience of the ſubiect towards his ſuperior, immediatly is againſt a man, and in the end it reacheth vnto God. The tyrannicall gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſuperiour bends immediatly againſt the ſubiect, but mediately againſt God. Our Author to delude our ſimplicity, when he is to ſpeak of the abuſe of authoritie, ſaith it is but againſt a ſubiect: when he ſpeakes of diſobedience, he ſaith it offends Gods Maieſtie in his vicar. If a man to incounter him ſhould ſay, The Prelate that abuſeth his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, offends God in his Creature; he that contemnes excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication offends a man: what could he replie? But let vs proceede ſyncerely, and lay theſe things togither euenly. Diſobedience offends God in the ſuperior; he that abuſeth the authority giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by god, offends God in the ſubiect. Now let vs ſee if theſe two offences made to God, whether is greater. S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who often makes the compariſon of ſins betweene themſelues, ſaith alwaies, that ſin is a priuation of that which is good, and therefore that a ſinne is ſo much the greater, the greater that the good is, which is depriued by it. The reader may ſee for this in 2.<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">a</hi>
               </hi> 2.<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">a</hi> quaeſtione.</hi> 150. <hi>art.</hi> 154. <hi>art.</hi> 3. 39. <hi>art.</hi> 2. and in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Now the good which diſobedience depriues a man of, is the priuate good of a ſubiect, which is the vertue of his obodience; the good which the abuſing of authority depriues vs of, is the good gouernance of the Church. This is a farre greater good, aſwell for that a publike good is greater then a priuate; as alſo for that to commaund well is a greater vertue, then to obey well: and this is the reaſon vpon which <hi>Gerſon</hi> is grounded, which is found, and ſtands not vpon authorities forced from their proper ſtates. He that would yet further conſider of the grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a ſinne, by the miſchiefe that inſues vpon it, or by the perſon that committeth it; howſoeuer theſe be but accidentall conſiderations, and we ought therefore to ground vpon the former, and not on them; yet neuertheleſſe one abuſe of power &amp; authoritie giues a greater ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to the world, and is a cauſe of greater miſchiefe, then a hundreth diſobediences; and the perſon of the ſuperiour, as the more eminent,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17244:29"/>
is much more bound by his greater obligation to God to doe his duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note> 
               <hi>I ſay that although in ſome caſe it may be meritorious to reſiſt a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to his face; yet for the most part it is a thing of much ſcandall, and of moſt grieuous exceſſe. And to apply this conſideration to the preſent purpoſe, to incite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are ſubiect, to diſpiſe the commandements of Chriſts vicar, it is a thing not to be indured. For Saint</hi> Paul <hi>made no reſistance againſt Saint</hi> Peter <hi>in matter of obedience, but in matter of a certaine obſeruation legall; and it pleaſed God to ſhew the world S.</hi> Peters <hi>humility, to permit that in a certain article of legall obſeruance S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſhould be illuminated beyond S.</hi> Peter: <hi>&amp; to S.</hi> Peter <hi>willingly accepted, S.</hi> Pauls <hi>brotherly correction, ſpecially for that S.</hi> Paule <hi>was an Apoſtle, and no leſſe full of the holy ghoſt then</hi> S. Peter <hi>himſelfe; but in matter of obedience and reuerence, we are to know that</hi> S. Paule <hi>alwaies exhorteth thoſe that are ſubiect, to obey their Prelates; and he himſelfe came in perſon to Ieruſalem to viſit</hi> S. Peter, <hi>and to conferre with him touching the goſpell he preached, notwithstanding that he had it by reuelation, as himſelfe teſtifies in the firſt chapter of the Epiſtle to the</hi> Galathians. <hi>Now what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence were this,</hi> Saint Paule <hi>an Apoſtle, and an elect veſſell tooke vpon him to admoniſh</hi> S. Peter: <hi>Ergo, the people ſhall doe a meritorious worke to reſiſt the ſupreame Biſhop to his face, though he commaund them vnder paine of Excommunication. This ſhould not be the conſequence of a good Logician, but of a peruerſe ſciſmaticke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſee not why it ſhould be heere laid in for a ſecond oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Gerſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gerſon.</note> that although it be ſometimes meritorious to reſiſt a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, yet it is ordinarily a thing of much ſcandall; &amp; ſince <hi>Gerſons</hi> words be, that ſometimes it is a thing meritorious, and turnes to the honour of the power Eccleſiaſticall, that reſiſtance be made to ſuch a Prelate with ſuch a moderation, as extends not the bounds of a lawful defence, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed himſelf to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> The Author to my vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding hath ſaid in effect the ſame with <hi>Gerſon,</hi> but that <hi>Gerſon</hi> hath with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity expreſſed all that was to be ſaid in this point, hauing added the limitation of ſuch a defence as was not to be reproued, for ſome thinks <hi>Gerſons</hi> Latine phraſe is more clearely expreſſed; <hi>Cum oppoſitione inculpatae tutilae.</hi> If the defence be vnreproueable, what would the Author haue more? who will be ſo raſh to ſay, that in an vnreproueable defence, there may be ſcandal or exceſſe? Let not the Author come in here with his, (ordinarily or for the moſt part) it is a ſcandal: for we will maintaine it vniuerſally by his fauour, that whenſoeuer there ſhall be a notorious abuſe of iuriſdiction in the Prelate, &amp; an irreproueable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17244:30"/>
defence in the ſubiect, it ſhall alwaies hold true, that it is a meritorious deed to reſiſt. And this is the very caſe, which <hi>Gerſon</hi> vnderſtands when he ſaith <hi>(ſometimes)</hi> and limits it beſides (as we ſee) with thoſe goul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den words; ſo that where the Author ſaith, that in ſome caſe it may be meritorious, it ſounds to me, that heere is put in by way of oppoſing againſt <hi>Gerſon,</hi> a flat confirmation of <hi>Gerſons</hi> owne opinion. But the Author followes it further. To apply this conſideration to the matter in queſtion, that is a thing not to be indured. This makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt <hi>Gerſon,</hi> but againſt the Interpretor; as though when he had tranſlated the twelue Conſiderations, he had ſaid with all, that all the twelue made expreſly for the caſe in hand. He ſhould haue done well to haue ſet downe the whole booke intier as it lies, and then it had beene the Readers part to apply that which is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied. By the ſame manner of dealing, becauſe <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaith in his ninth conſideration, If the Pope would ſeaze vpon the Churches treaſure, or vſurp vpon it inheritance, or reduce all the Clergy &amp; their goods into ſeruitude, or ſpoyle them of their rights without cauſe, the Author may obiect it againſt the Interpretor, that he hath applied all this to the point in queſtion, and that his meaning is indeed; that the Pope doth ſnatch at the Churches treaſures &amp;c. No, it is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but peraduenture the Author who ſaith ful wel the reaſons, why this preſent fifth conſideration maketh for the preſent purpoſe, he laies it couragiouſly all at once vpon the Interpretor. Now whether S. <hi>Pauls</hi> example be well alleaged by <hi>Gerſon</hi> or no, I will ſay but this, that yet Cardinall <hi>Cajetan</hi> hath alleaged it to this ſelfe ſame purpoſe in his <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcula;</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleageth <hi>Cajetan</hi> in his ſecond booke <hi>de Romano Pontifice</hi> to the very ſame purpoſe, &amp; directs vs to ſee the place; yea and this example hath beene yet further alleaged to the ſame purpoſe, by <hi>Dominicus Solus,</hi> and by <hi>Franciſcus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictoria,</hi> and by other moſt renowmed Doctors. It is true which the Author ſaith that S. <hi>Paul</hi> reſiſted not S. <hi>Peter</hi> for any excommunication matter (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not then the vſe to thunder it out as now it is) and that S. <hi>Paul</hi> proceeded againſt the inceſtuous Corinthian preciſely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſts inſtitution: but it is alſo true withall, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> at Antiochia in the fact we ſpeake of, did by his example as it were ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently command all them that were preſent in that place, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes it. <hi>Et ſimulationi eius conſenſerunt caeteri Iudaei, ita vt &amp;</hi> Barnabas <hi>duceretur ab eis in illam ſimulationem.</hi> To this ſilent precept S. <hi>Paul</hi> made reſiſtancie; and let not the Author tell vs, that there was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17244:30"/>
no queſtion or meaning there of any precept, and obedience. For in deed it was intended and meant, but ouermuch: but further the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it ſelfe is very ſtrong, that if we may reſiſt a Superior in a precept which he makes out ſilently by his owne examples; much more may we do it againſt a precept expreſſe and fulminatory.</p>
            <p>I ſee not to what end the Author after this brings in the ſtory how S. <hi>Paule</hi> went to viſit S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to conferre with him of the Goſpell which he preached; ſure I am the ſcripture ſaith not ſo, the words are theſe: <hi>Deinde poſt annos tres veni Hieroſolymam videre Petrum, &amp; manſi apud eum diebus quindecim. Alium autem Apoſtolorum vidi neminem, niſi Iacobum fratrem Domini. Quae autem ſcribo vobis, ecce coram Deo quia non mentior: deinde veni in partes Syriae, &amp;c.</hi> There is indeed in the next Chapter. <hi>Deinde poſt annos quatuordecim iterum aſcendi Hieroſolymam cum Barnabo aſſumpto &amp; Tito; aſcendi autem ſecundum reuelationem, &amp; contuli cum illis Euangelium, quod praedico in gentibus.</hi> In his firſt voyage he ſpeakes of his viſiting S. <hi>Peter</hi> but not a word of any conferring with him; in the ſecond not a word of viſiting, but he ſpeakes indeed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring, not with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>cum illis,</hi> howſoeuer true it is, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was among them. Here the Author hath put for one onely vyage, two of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſeuerall voyages, the one more then 14. years diſtant from the other. And that ſame <hi>Contuli cum illis,</hi> which is meant, with the whole Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or if you will not take it ſo, then at leaſt with the three Apoſtles, <hi>Iames, Caefas</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> (for S. <hi>Paul</hi> names them in this order) the Author vnderſtands it, he conferred with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> But I would faine know why when he treats of this conferring, he doth not here add, <hi>Mihi enim, qui videbantur, eſſe aliquid nihil contule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt. Sed è contra cum vidiſſent, quod creditum est mihi Euangelium praepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tij, ſicut</hi> Petro <hi>circumciſionis. Qui enim operatus eſt Petro in Apoſtolatum circumciſionis operatus eſt, &amp; mihi inter gentes; &amp; cum cognouiſſent gratiam quae data eſt mihi, Iacobus &amp;</hi> Caefas <hi>&amp;</hi> Ioannes, <hi>qui videbantur columnae eſſe, dextras dederunt mihi &amp;</hi> Barnabae <hi>ſocietatis, vt not in gentes, ipſi autem incircumciſionem, tantum vt pauperum memores eſſemus:</hi> for it may be that out of theſe wordes he would haue drawen the deduction of the conſequence. The ſcripture recounts vs two of S. <hi>Peters</hi> actions for which he was reprehended after he had receiued the holy Ghoſt; one in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> the ſecond in the 11. of the <hi>Actes,</hi> when the Iewes that were conuerted contended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> for hauing receiued the Gentiles into the Church.

In the firſt there was a fault on <hi>Peters</hi> part; in the ſecond he was bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without cauſe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid it of the olde Teſtament, <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque ſcripta ſunt, ad noſtram doctrinam ſcripta ſunt;</hi> and we may ſay the ſame of both old and new. For in this ſecond example a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour is taught with what charitie, and with what manner of doctrine he ought to informe his ſubiects capacitie and vnderſtanding, in caſe he doe contend with him, yea though it be againſt reaſon. Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> he did not excommunicate thoſe Iewes, but inſtructed them with the authoritie of diuine reuelations: and if there ought to haue beene v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any other manner of proceeding with the State of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> let the Author ſhew me but one example in the ſcripture, that we may reſt vpon it. In that other example of the Epiſtle to the Galathians, ſince he doth not repeat that which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> aunſwered, but only what S. <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed, there is no inſtruction giuen the Prelate, but to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, how he ought to carie himſelf when the ſuperior abuſeth his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And this ſelfeſame note ſhews how farre of it is from this ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures true ſenſe, that God ſhould thus diſpoſe that that then fell out to ſhew <hi>Peters</hi> humility, for that it would haue been pertinent to haue ſet downe the humble anſwere of that Saint; but contrariwiſe the ſcripture omits what S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, and ſets downe onely S. <hi>Pauls</hi> graue rebuke, to demonſtrate it that the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple was giuen not for S. <hi>Peters</hi> humility, but to inſtruct inferiors how they ought to beare themſelues toward their ſuperiours; and in that there is no mention made of any ſcandall at all that grew after vpon it, we may likewiſe hope that if now there ſhall grow any, it ſhall be but an offence taken, and not giuen. If the Author haue yet any other place of ſcripture, where any ſuperiour hath exceeded his bounds, and the inferiour hath not made conuenient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, let him produce it, and we will in like ſort reſt vpon it. We doe conceiue this conſequence for formall &amp; ſtrong. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> erred, <hi>Ergo</hi> euery Pope may erre. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> a moſt humble man made him reſiſtance, <hi>Ergo,</hi> reſiſtance will not misbeſeeme one of leſſe humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.

was no good Logician, but a perverſe Sciſmatique. But for this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſequence S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts inferiors to obey their Prelats, and came to viſit S. <hi>Peter. Ergo,</hi> we muſt obey, yea though they abuſe their power: we refer it to the Author to ſtile it with what name pleaſe him; and if he ſhall ſay that he ſpeakes not of the abuſe, but of the lawfull vſe of power; why <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſpake onely of the abuſe, and not of the vſe of it; and we condemne all them that obey not their ſuperiours, when they commaund according to his preſcript that gaue them their authority aſwell as we condemne the ſuperiors that abuſe it.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The ſixt conſideration is, that ſuch a caſe may be put,<note place="margin">Gerſon</note> that one in not obeying his Prelate, ſhall be a contemner of his keyes, and another likewiſe in not obeying ſhall be in no contempt: as where the firſt ſhall beleeue the Prelates ſentence to be iuſt, or ſhall beleeue for ſome other reaſon that he is bound to obey it, and where the ſecond ſhal know for certaine, or ſhall haue ſufficient probability, that his Prelate miſuſeth the power of the keyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this conſideration there is little to ſay, but that euery probability,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine</note> 
               <hi>or a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babity of euery abuſe whatſoeuer, is not ſufficient to exempt a man from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to his Prelate. But that a man ſhould be freed from ſuch obeyſance, it muſt be certaine and notorious (auoiding to the common receiued learning) that the Prelate doe abuſe this power in ſome eſſentiall point; for it is a generall rule gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by S.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>libro.</hi> 22. <hi>contra</hi> Fauſtum. <hi>cap.</hi> 75. <hi>and followed by the reſt, that the ſubiect ſtands bound to obey, not onely when it is certaine that the ſuperiour doth not commaund any thing against God, but alſo when he is not certaine, whether he commands any thing againſt God, or no; becauſe that in a doubtfull caſe, he is to follow his ſuperiour iudgement, &amp; not his owne; and then onely he muſt not obey, when he is aſſured, that he commands againſt God; for that, as it was ſaid before, Obediendum est Deo magis quam hominibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know not what to ſay in this ſixt Conſideration,<note place="margin">Frier Paul</note> but to merueile at it, that the Author out of a deſire of contradiction, giues it a limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which <hi>Gerſon</hi> himſelfe gaue in like ſort, in fewer and playner termes. For where <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaith: It may fall ſo out, that in the ſame caſe, one may become diſobedient in contempt, and another without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one ſhal repute the ſentence for iuſt, or that he is bound to obey it for ſome other reſpect; &amp; this other ſhal not ſo think of it, but either knows it of certainty, or hath ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t probability that his Prelate vſeth his authority amiſſe in preiudice of the keys; the Author limits it that for ſooth euery probability is not ſufficient. <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaith not euery probability whatſoeuer, but a ſufficient probability; and I ſay, &amp; affirme
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17244:32"/>
and warrant it, that a ſufficient probabilitie is enough, and in matters humane and morall it is as great aſſurance and certaintie as can be ſaid; neither can I beleeue that any man will ſay, that which is ſufficient is not enough, vnleſſe he will contradict himſelfe. So that all the Author ſaith in many words, is compriſed in one ſhort and plaine terme by <hi>Gerſon,</hi> and they are agreed. But I would not now haue any man decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by that which the Author adds, <hi>Viz.</hi> That in a doubtfull caſe a man is to follow the iudgement of the ſuperiour, and not his owne. For a caſe may be ſaid to be doubtfull in two ſences: either doubtfull, wherein a man hath not indeuored to reſolue himſelfe; or doubtfull, wherein after his due diligence imployed, he cannnot yet reſolue himſelfe. In the firſt caſe, he that ſtands in doubt, whether the thing commaunded be againſt God, is bound to put in practiſe all poſſible meanes both by himſelfe, and with the helpe of others to cleare his owne iudgement, or elſe he ſinnes againſt God by expoſing himſelfe to hazard the breaking of his law. He that after all his diligence remaines ſtill in doubt, the Doctors allow him to follow the iudgement of his ſuperiour. I thinke well that the Author hath this verie ſame meaning, but it behooues vs to ſtand vpon our gard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ambiguities, becauſe all falſe doctrines make their firſt ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance masked with the name of good. And he doth ſo often inculcate it heere, That the ſubiect is bound to obey, not only when he is aſſured that the ſuperiour doth not commaund any thing againſt God, but alſo when he is vncertaine whether he commaunds any thing againſt God, or not; becauſe that in a doubtfull caſe he is to follow his ſuperiours iudgement, and not his owne; and then onely he muſt not obey, when he is aſſured that he commaunds againſt God: that we are inforced to reply ioyntly withall, that his aſſertion is not true, ſauing onely where the ſubiect is not reſolued that the Superiour commands ought againſt God after he ſhall haue conſulted ſufficiently of it; and in a caſe ſtill doubtful after conſultation he hath to follow the iudgement of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour; and then he is not to obey, when he is aſſured, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds againſt God: but if he ſtand in doubt, becauſe he hath not well thought of it, then is he bound to bethinke himſelfe ſeriouſly of it firſt, before he yeeld obedience. Yet my meaning is not, that from hence there ſhould be drawen this concluſion, that as the ſubiect is bound to obey in a caſe inuincibly doubtfull (for ſo I will terme it to auoyde Aequiuocation) ſo that the Superiour may in like
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17244:32"/>
manner commaund in ſuch a caſe; for he ſinnes alwaies whenſoeuer he commands that with himſelfe is not aſſured to be obligatorie. So doth <hi>Adrian</hi> prooue and conclude. <hi>Quodl.</hi> 1. For the authority of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, doth not extend to things doubtfull, and it is againſt the lawe of nature (ſaith <hi>Adrian</hi>) to affirme, that the authority of the keyes is extended to that which is doubtfull; but the ſubiect is bound in a caſe inuincibly doubtfull to obey, becauſe hee ought to beleeue, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be doubtfull to him, yet it is not doubtfull to his Superiour. But in caſe he were aſſured, that it were a like doubtfull to his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, then he is not bound at all to obey him. So that when the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our commaunds in a doubtfull caſe, and the ſubiect knowes, that the Superiour himſelfe holds it for doubtfull, and yet commands it to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage him ſelfe, here he is not bound to obey him. It ſhall not be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to repeate it ouer againe, that the doubt which bindes a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to obedience, muſt of neceſſity haue twoe conditions. Firſt that it be a doubt inuincible to himſelfe; and the other that hee come not to knowe, that the Superiour himſelfe holds it doubtfull, as well as he.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The ſeuenth conſideration is,<note place="margin">Gerſon.</note> that to diſcouer aright the contempt of the keyes, we muſt obſerue the lawfull power, and withall the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of this power; and therefore that ſame common ſaying, that the ſentence of the Paſtor, or of the Iudge, it ought to be feared, yea though it be vniuſt, it needes a good gloſe. <hi>This is a good conſideration,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine:</note> 
               <hi>and the gloſſe of that common ſaying, it is extant in the ſacred cannons, among which alſo is the verie ſame ſaying, viz. in Gratians decreetum, cauſa</hi> 11. <hi>quaeſtione tertia, and that in ſundry Chapters. And the ſumme of all is, that the Paſtors ſentence is to bee feared, when it is vniuſt, ſo it bee of force, and good in Law, as when there wants not any one eſſentiall part, but onely ſome accidentall matter; for example, a lawfull Prelate excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates one that is vnder his iuriſdiction for a iuſt cauſe, hauing before admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and aduiſed him, but he doth not excommunicate him for pure zeale of iuſtice, but for ſome particular grudge he beares him, or he doth not warne him three times, or he doth not put downe the ſentence in ſcriptis; this excommuni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation is vniuſt, but it is ſtrong in law, &amp; therefore ought to be feared. Yea &amp; admit yet further, that it were indeed voide, but the inualiditie were not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, here it ought likewiſe to be feared, at leaſt in reſpect of the ſcandall. I doe not straine my ſelfe to prooue theſe things, for that they are cleare, &amp; ſuch as Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon himſelfe would not denie them. And from this conſideration, any man may
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17244:33"/>
gather, that the ſentence of of our Lord Paulus Quintus publiſhed againſt the heads of the State of Venice, hath all the requiſites aswell eſſentiall, as acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall, and ought therefore to be feared, it beeing not onely of validitie, but moſt iuſt withall. For if you looke into the lawfulneſſe of authority, you ſhall finde, that there is a ſupreame power giuen him from God, and moſt vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall ouer all them which pretend to bee ſheepe of Chriſts flock, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the mysticall body of the Church, and citiſens of Gods citie, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestiques in the houſe of the ſame God. That the power is vniuerſall, it is cleerely ſeene in thoſe words, Quodcunque ligaueris, &amp; quodounque Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueris, Math.</hi> 16. <hi>And that it is ouerall, it is ſeene in thoſe other words, paſce oxes meas. Iohn.</hi> 21. <hi>Where it is not restrayned to theſe or thoſe ſheepe, but includeth all thoſe that are his: and hee that beleeues not this, is no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick. If you looke into the lawfull vſe of this power, you ſhall finde that there wanted not diuerſe admonitions, nor any of thoſe things which the order of iudgment requires. Finally if you looke into the cauſe you ſhall finde that it was in defence of the Churches immunitie, which the ſacred councell of Trent. Seſſ.</hi> 25. <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>affirmeth to bee founded vpon diuine ordination, and vpon the conſtitutions of the holy canons, and for which wee knowe that many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prelates haue combated euen to the death. God hath honoured Saint.

               <note place="margin">Frier Paulo.</note>In this ſeuenth conſideration it pleaſed the Author to bring in the Gloſſe vpon that common ſaying, That the ſentence of the Paſtor, or of the iudge it is to be feared, yea though it be vniuſt, which Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thought good to let paſſe, as a gloſſe moſt knowne and handled of all the Doctors. Yea further I for my parte doe not onely ſubſcribe to that which the Author ſaies, but I adde this more, that euen ſuch a ſentence as is notoriouſly voyde in lawe, ought notwithſtanding to be feared after a ſorte, that is to ſay, wee ought not proudly to diſdaine and contemne it, but with modeſty and reuerence to hinder the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it.

If it be taken in the right ſenſe, ſuch as be Catholicks make no difficultie to admit of this (propoſition; but this ſame new termed <hi>Vniuerſalium</hi> (moſt vniverſall) is one of thoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous words, which though it be firſt broght in in a good ſenſe, that is to ſay, bounded &amp; limited in things only belonging to the kingdom heauen, and to the edification of the Church according to the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall rules; yet in tract of time it will after extend and ſtraine it ſelfe further euen to mundane and worldly matters. S. <hi>Gregory. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>epiſt</hi> 30. held this very word for <hi>ſuſpicious,</hi> and in exceeding iealouſie, when he was ſtyled <hi>Papa vniuerſalis,</hi> and he ſaid, it was a proud title, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported as much, as if he were the onely Biſhop, and no other man were Biſhop but he. And ſo to haue authoritie moſt vniuerſall, is after a ſort to ſay (if Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> diſcourſe may be allowed) that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authority but it. For if the ſtile of vniuerſall Biſhop take away other Biſhops; <hi>Ergo,</hi> a moſt vniuerſall authority muſt needs take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all other authorities. But we will not contend about the word, ſo that they wil giue it it owne true meaning.

But in the 18. of <hi>Mathew</hi> it is ſaid to all the Diſciples, and in their perſon to their ſucceſſors, <hi>Quaecunque ligaueritis, &amp;c. Quaecunque ſolueritis &amp;c. Ergo,</hi> there ſhall be ſundrie moſt vniuerſall authorities, which implies a flat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction.

that many, and thoſe of the moſt neceſſarie and eſſentiall points in law were wanting, &amp; it will appeare vnto him, that the cauſe is not for defence of the Eccleſiaſticall communities, as thy Author affirmes without proofe; And if matters lye ſo cleare as he profeſſes, why do they not publiſh to the world their rights and proceedings Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall <hi>in facto,</hi> and <hi>in iure?</hi> And why do they not lay open to the world to ſee the proceedings and reaſons of the Venetian State, and ſo make them reſt conuict? It beares no ſhew, that forbidding men to write, tends to any ſuch end, but in very deede to the end to conceale the truth, and to ſhewe the cauſe to the world, vnder a maske, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelfe doth in this very place, when he ſaith that <hi>Paulus Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his ſentence publiſhed againſt the heads of the Venetian State hath all it requiſites, and yet the two ſentences which were intimated, one on the day of the natiuitie, and the other on the fiue and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of February, do both excommunicate the State it ſelfe, and not the heads, as in place it ſhall appeare. I cannot now paſſe ouer here the conſideration of a great ſkill of the Authors, who citing the place of the Councell, <hi>Seſſione</hi> 25. <hi>Cap,</hi> 20. makes the Councell ſay, that the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall immunitie is founded vppon diuine ordination, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the conſtitutions of the ſacred Canons; This was no place to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into treaty of that matter; neither was it ſo conuenient, with a few ambiguous termes to plant a Doctrine, that needes much extenſion, or elſe will be very ſubiect to be conuerted to peruert the peaceable State of the holy Church. But to ſay no more at this time, but onely ſo much as may ſuffice for an Antidot to the Reader, it may pleaſe him to be aduertiſed that my Lord Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Clericis, cap.</hi> 28. ſets downe certaine concluſions of this very point. The firſt is, that in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, the Clergie are free, <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any ſecular Princes authority. The fift is, that the exemption of the Clergy in matters politicall, aſwel in reſpect of their perſons, as of their goods, was brought in by the law of man, and not of God. See then how the Councell intends it, when it ſaith that Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call exemption is inſtituted <hi>iure diuino,</hi> that is, in cauſes eccleſiaſticall. And the Author hee ſhould haue tranſlated <hi>conſtitutam ordinatione diuiua,</hi> inſtituted by diuine ordination, and not haue made it (foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded): for that his firſt worde ſeemes to importe, that the Canons had authoritie from GOD to inſtitute it, and that it is eſtabliſhed vpon this foundation; but it is nothing ſo. Their exemption in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17244:34"/>
cauſes ſpirituall is totally and expreſly, <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is is totally and expreſly <hi>de iure humano.</hi> To his example of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> I will allowe him well, that hee dyed for the Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> but for that which was truly Eccleſiaſticall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede; and not for indeuouring to bring to paſſe, that delinquents ſhould not bee puniſhed, or that Churchmen ſhould haue ſo much more poſſeſſions, then their owne parte, and place. But if a man ſhould here inſteede of the conſequence drawne hence by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, draw the quite contrarie in his owne forme and ſay; And from this conſideration any man may gather that Pope <hi>Paulus Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his ſentences thundred out againſt the Duke, the Senate, and the State of Venice, and all their dominion do want many eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all requiſits, to omit thoſe that are accidentall, and therefore are not to bee feared, as beeing not onely voide in forme, but vniuſt; the contrarie conſequence would bee neuer a whit better prooued by the Author, then this is prooued in this place. But it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to doe it here, where we haue nothing elſe to maintaine, but Gerſons defence. Onely this wee muſt auowe and ſay, that euerie man is one of Chriſts ſheepe, but God hath giuen them a naturall defence, if the ſhephearde ſhall not follow the inſtitution of the ſupreame Paſtor.</p>
            <p>The eight conſideration is,<note place="margin">Gerſon.</note> that the abuſe of the keyes in the <hi>Pope,</hi> is more dangerous then in inferiour prelates, becauſe in caſe they bee abuſed by inferiours. It is lawfull to appeale to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but from the <hi>Pope,</hi> no appeale is admitted, ſaue onely too a generall counſell, which is not ſo eaſily aſſembled. And howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer before the Counſell of Conſtance, it was the opinion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that it was vnlawfull to appeale from the <hi>Pope</hi> to the Councell, yet in that counſell it was expreſly declared hereſie, to deny that the councell was ſuperiour to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note> 
               <hi>This conſideration containes a great and manifeſt errour, and hee which did produce it, with a purpoſe to apply it to the buſineſſe now in hand, diſcouereth himſelfe not to bee catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqulie affected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is requiſite that I inſiſt ſomewhat longer vppon this eight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, not that the matter it ſelfe doth ſo require,<note place="margin">Frier Paulo.</note> but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hauing made a long and artificiall diſcourſe vpon it, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17244:35"/>
that I diſcouer the ſecrets and ſubtilties thereof, in ſuch ſorte, as the reader may not thereby bee carried away from the truth. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in this conſideration affirmeth that the contempt of the keyes towards the perſon of the Pope is more dangerous then towards an inferiour, the Author inuerts his wordes, and maketh him ſay that the abuſe of the keyes in the <hi>Pope</hi> is more dangerous then in inferiours: is this faithfully to reporte the opinion, which wee vndertake to confute? <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſpeaketh of the contempt of the Popes commaundement, in thoſe that are ſubiect vnto him, and ſaith, that that contempt is more daungerous then any towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of inferiour Prelates.</p>
            <p>The Author chargeth him to ſay, that the Pope in abuſing the keyes, doth offend more daungerouſly then an inferiour prelate ſo as that which one ſpeaketh, of the action of a ſubiect towarde a ſuperiour.</p>
            <p>The other ſpeaketh of the action of a ſuperiour towards thoſe that are ſubiect vnto him; one ſpeaketh of contempt, and that of a ſubiect; the other ſpeaketh of the abuſe of the keyes, and that in a ſuperiour; this conſideration of Gerſon is in fauour of the Sea Apoſtolique, and ſheweth that our proceeding towards it, ought to bee accompanied with greater reuerence; ſaying, that the contempt thereof is more daungerous, then the contempt of others.</p>
            <p>The Author maketh him ſay the contrarie, that the abuſes of the keyes in the Pope are more daungerous then the abuſes of inferiours, from whence it may bee gathered, that leſſe reſpect is due to that Sea, then to the Seas of other Prelates. Is this to diſpute? or is it to enforce men to hould opinions to bee ſure of ſomething to contradict? How can the Author anſwere it? <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> principall ſcope in this conſideration, is nothing elſe but to make it appeare, that in oppoſing againſt the commaundements and cenſures of prelates, wee muſt alſo haue a further regarde, that wee oppoſe not againſt thoſe of the Pope; and tells the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17244:35"/>
reaſon of it, becauſe from inferiours, wee may haue recourſe to the Pope. And maketh an obiection againſt himſelfe; if any man ſhould ſay that wee may appeale in like ſorte, from the Pope to a Councell, hee anſwereth that this allegation hath ſometime beene held of no force, namely when the Popes haue beene ſaid to bee aboue the Councell.</p>
            <p>But howſoeuer this cannot bee ſaid (ſaith hee) at this inſtant for thoſe reaſons which hee alleadgeth, neuertheleſſe euen acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that this is true, yet for another reaſon, it is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to reſiſt him, becauſe Councells cannot eaſilie bee ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, nor ought not vppon ſo ſmall occaſions as the hearing of appeales; Lo here the true ſenſe of this conſideration, from which if you remoue that point of <hi>Superioritie,</hi> you ſhall finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which euen in the Authors opinion can bee worthy of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
            <p>And this is ſpoken by the way. But the Author mindeing onely his owne ends, and looking no further, hath taken this for a principall parte of the conſideration, ſaying, it containes a very great and manifeſt errour, and that hee which did produce it with a purpoſe to apply it to the buſineſſe nowe in hande, diſcouereth himſelfe not to bee Catholiquely affected, hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth verie well, that his Common-wealth neuer thought it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to take the benifit of an appeale, for both the Prince, and Senate haue made publique declaration, whereupon they intend to inſiſte; this then cannot bee produced with a purpoſe for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affaires.</p>
            <p>What intention hee had which did interpret Gerſon, before the publiſhing this declaration, no man can coniecture, neither is it charitable to iudge: But whereas hee ſaith, that hee is not catholiquely affected, it may bee, hee doth not remember the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Cardinall Bellarmine, who in his ſecond booke of the authoritie of a Counſell, and thirteenth chapter, intituled. <hi>An conſilium ſit ſupra Papam</hi> ſaith, <hi>&amp; quamuis poſtea in concilio Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentino,

Ideo vſque ad hanc diem quaſtio ſupereſt etiam inter Catholices.</hi> Let him reuiew this doctrine written before this paſſion, wherewithall the preſent affayres are accompanied, becauſe to free himſelfe from this contradiction, I ſee not what he can alleage ſaue only that in the 17. chapter he ſpeaketh otherwiſe, ſaying as followeth of the Lateran Councell. <hi>Quod vero Conciliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hoc rem istam non diffinirit propriè, vt decretum de Fide Catholica tenendum, dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſt, &amp; ideo non ſunt propriè haeretici, qui contrarium ſentiuut, ſed à temeritate magna excuſari non poſſunt.</hi> Certainely there ſeemeth to be little agreement betweene theſe two ſo neere neighbouring pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for to charge them with raſhneſſe whom himſelfe cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to be Catholickes, ſeemeth to proceede from no great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Charitie, but this laſt place will not inable him to prooue that the interpreter is not Catholickely affected; for an opinion may ſometimes be raſh, and yet more true then the contrarie. In times paſt, the common opinion was that the Angels were corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and it was then accounted raſhneſſe to affirme that they are incorporall, at this time the common opinion is that they are in corporeall, and it is no longer raſhneſſe to maintaine it, and ſo for our purpoſe: But <hi>Martin Nauara</hi> vpon the Chapter, <hi>Nouit de iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciis,</hi> alleaging the words of <hi>Iohn Maior</hi> doth verie well declare that the queſtion is in controuerſie, and that in Rome it is not permitted to holde the doctrine of <hi>Panormitan</hi> which vpholdeth the Souerainety of the Counſell, neyther doth the vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that any man ſhould hold the contrarie.</p>
            <p n="4">4 What ſhall we ſay of <hi>Iohn Mariana,</hi> a moderne Ieſuite, who in his booke <hi>de Rege,</hi> approoued by the publicke examination of the Ieſuits: as alſo by another examination made by the authority Royall of <hi>Spayne</hi> ſaith plainely, that great Authors are of contrarie opinions in this queſtion, but certainely this cannot be cald a raſh opinion, becauſe raſh opinion according to <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> who hath exactly handled the definition of it,) is ſuch a one, as hath lney ther reaſon nor authority to approoue it; or otherwiſe is ouer bold y maintayned, but an opinion which hath the conſent of as many and

               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:17244:36"/>
if not a greater number of Vniuerſities, Countries, and Kingdomes, cannot be ſayd to be mayntained without reaſon &amp; authoritie; nor yet audaciouſly. It is not a charitable courſe, ſo haſtily to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne men of raſhnes; but if the Author would needs Diſcouer his affection, he ſhould haue expreſſed his meaning in three or foure wordes, and ſaued the labour of ſo long a Diſcourſe; to ſhew that <hi>Gerſon</hi> held a falſe opinion, and enforce men to thinke of ſo great an Author, that hee affirmeth that which hath no affinitie with his wordes; for he makes a ſolemne entraunce to the handling of the queſtion, and ſayth thus.</p>
            <p>And to begin with the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note> three thinges are to be obſerued in it: The firſt, that that Councell did neuer declare it hereſie, to denie that the Councell was ſuperiour to the <hi>Pope</hi> let him ouerlooke that Councell againe and againe, and nothing ſhall be found in it tending to that purpoſe. The ſecond, that the aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Councell in the 4. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> maketh a decree, wherein it doth declare that that Councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> doth repreſent the Church vniuerſall, and hath authoritie immediatly from Chriſt, wherevnto euery one is bounde to yeelde obedience, euen the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe: which decree (as by men of moſt learning it is interpreted) is not to be extended to all <hi>Popes,</hi> but onely to thoſe, of whom men are not certaine, whether they be <hi>Popes</hi> or noe: which was the caſe at that time, when three ſeuerall perſons tooke vpon them the <hi>Papaſie,</hi> and had their ſeuerall followers. And in this caſe it is moſt certaine, that the Church hath power to declare to whom the <hi>Papacie</hi> doth appertaine; and that they which in time of Sciſme doe contende for it, are ſubiect to the determination of the Church, and of the generall Councell: But when once the <hi>Pope</hi> is canonically choſen, and vndoubtedly accepted for <hi>Pope,</hi> it cannot be gathered out of that decree, that he is bound to ſubmit himſelfe either to the Church, or to the Councell. The third, that this decree can haue no force, ſaue onely for the redreſsing of that Schiſme; for there beeing at that time no <hi>Pope</hi> in the Councell, the Councell was a body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a head, and conſequently had no authoritie to determine any thing in matters of Fayth, or in other matters of like importance. And though Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, did ratifie that Councell, yet did he ratifie it onely ſo farre foorth, as the decrees were made
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17244:37"/>
               <hi>Conciliariter,</hi> as thoſe were which were decreed againſt the hereſies of <hi>Iohn Wickliffe,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> but that decree of the Superioritie of the Councell aboue the <hi>Pope,</hi> was not decreed <hi>Conciliariter;</hi> that is to ſay, vpon deliberation, and diſputations preceding, and by an orderly collection of the voyces of the Fathers; but it was a decree ſimply intended for the redreſsing of that Schiſme: wherevpon afterwardes, <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, in the Councell of <hi>Mantua,</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate whomſoeuer ſhould appeale from the <hi>Pope</hi> to the Councell.

And ſince that time, all the <hi>Popes</hi> haue renewed it in the <hi>Bull,</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>In caena Domini.</hi> Finally, <hi>Pope Martin</hi> the fift, by the conſent of that Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> declareth, that they which are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of Hereſie, ought to be interrogated of many Articles, and perticularly whether they doe beleeue that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power in the Church of God: and certainely if the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power be in the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot be inferiour to the Councell, for ſo the ſuperioritie ſhould reſt in the Councell, and not in the <hi>Pope:</hi> whereby it doth appeare, that the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> in that decree of the 4. <hi>Seſ.</hi> is ſo to be vnderſtoode, as wee haue expounded it, otherwiſe it ſhould be contrary to it ſelfe; and admitting that there is a contrarietie, wee ought rather to giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to the ſecond decree, beeing made by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Councell together; then to the firſt, beeing made by the Councell without the <hi>Pope;</hi> that is to ſay, by a body without a head.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Frier Paulo</note>I will not affirme the opinion of <hi>Gerſon</hi> to be true; or mayntaine either his doctrine, or his reaſons in this <hi>Apologie;</hi> but this I will ſay, that the reaſons which the Author doth produce againſt him, haue been conſidered, and anſwered, eyther by <hi>Gerſon</hi> himſelfe, or by ſome other of his opinion, which haue written ſince his time: and here I will ſet downe ſome of thoſe reſolutions, not that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to take vpon mee to determine any thing, but onely to ſhew that the queſtion is to be diſputed with more ſollide arguments; and that Writers ſo excellent both for learning, and pietie, are not ſo haſtily to be condemned.</p>
            <p>Concerning that Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> alleadged by <hi>Gerſon,</hi> our Author hath three Obſeruations: The firſt is that, that Councell
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17244:37"/>
hath no where declared it Hereſie, to denie the ſuperioritie of the Councell aboue the <hi>Pope:</hi> if the Authors meaning be that theſe expreſſe wordes (it is Hereſie to denie the ſuperioritie of the Councell, aboue the <hi>Pope</hi>) are not to be found in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, he ſpeaketh but the trueth: if he will ſay further, that the Councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> hath not ſaid, that hee is <hi>Anathema</hi> which denieth the Superioritie of the Councell, hee ſayeth as truely. Neuertheleſſe <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth deny that the Councell hath not determined it, which I deſire may be taken for <hi>Gerſons</hi> opinion, and not mine owne; and after ſuch manner as is vſuall in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fayth, and ſayth, that it was reputed Hereſie to holde the contrary: this is to be ſeene in the fourth <hi>Seſ.</hi> where theſe wordes are vſed, <hi>Ordinat, diſponit, ſtatuit, decernit, &amp; declarat:</hi> And in the fift <hi>Seſ.</hi> where the ſame doctrine is repeated in theſe wordes, <hi>Ordinat, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, decernit, &amp; declarat.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſayth in this conſideration, that it is Hereſie condemned by moſt expreſſe conſtitution, &amp; put in practiſe by the ſaid coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> as is elſe where more largely ſet down. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may read, the places mentioned by <hi>Gerſon</hi> in his workes; where he ſhall ſee that which will ſerue for anſwere to theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections. The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> hath doubtleſſe condemned it for Hereſie, to denie Purgatorie; &amp; yet you ſhall not find where it ſayth, that it is Hereſie to denie Purgatorie; or that he is <hi>Anathema</hi> which doth denie it. But the doctrine of Purgatorie is ſufficiently expreſſed in <hi>Seſ.</hi> 25. and 22. in ſuch ſort, as it is euident that it is determined as a matter of Fayth; and hee which in the queſtion of Purgatorie ſhould vſe the Authors wordes, and ſay, that the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> hath no where declared it Hereſie to denie Purgatorie; let him read ouer the Councell againe and againe, and no ſuch thing ſhall there be found; ſhould ſhew that hee is more ententiue to the wordes, then to the meaning of the Councell: In like manner it may be ſayd of <hi>Gerſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Obſeruation of the Author againſt <hi>Gerſon,</hi> is; That men of moſt learning doe expounde this Decree of the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> as ſpoken of a <hi>Pope</hi> vncertaine, which is moſt true, and not of a certaine <hi>Pope:</hi> this ſecond Obiection
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17244:38"/>
doth in all, and euery part of it contradict the former: for if the Decree of the Councell, bee it what it will, doth not make him an Hereticke which is of a contrary opinion; and that it be to be vnderſtood of a <hi>Pope</hi> vncertaine, then it is no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie to denie that a <hi>Pope</hi> vncertaine, is ſubiect to a Councell: But to ſay that ſuch a <hi>Pope</hi> is not ſubiect to a Councell, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly hereſie: ſo that whoſoeuer will affirme that the Decree is to be expounded of a <hi>Pope</hi> vncertain, muſt acknowledge it to be ſuch a Decree as maketh the contrarie opinion to be Hereticall. And whoſoeuer will affirme, that it is not a Decree of this nature, muſt affirme alſo, that it is vnderſtood of a Pope certaine:</p>
            <p>It is true (as the Author ſayth) that very Learned men doe expound it as ſpoken of a <hi>Pope</hi> vncertaine; but it is as true, that very Learned doe expound it as ſpoken of a <hi>Pope</hi> certaine: yet this difference is to be obſerued, that they which doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde it of a <hi>Pope</hi> vncertaine, were not preſent at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: But they which doe vnderſtand it of a <hi>Pope</hi> certaine, were all thoſe which were preſent at the Councell, and haue left any writings; and beſides them, all thoſe which ſuruiued, and beeing not otherwiſe hindered, were preſent in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Baſill;</hi> which of neceſsitie muſt be many, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe two Councels, there was the ſpace of fifteene yeares.</p>
            <p>Furthermore the Author ought to obſerue, that <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth not onely ſay, condemned, but practiſed: and to conſider the practiſe of that Councell, and obſerue; if that Councell did not commaund as well the <hi>Popes</hi> certaine, as vncertaine, let him read the <hi>Seſ.</hi> 17. and there he ſhall finde that the Councell doth decree, that no future Pope ſhall haue power to depoſe <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo Corrario,</hi> formerly called <hi>Gregorie,</hi> 12. eyther from beeing a Cardinall, or from his office of Legate <hi>Della Marca,</hi> which the Councell beſtowed vpon him; or haue any power to call him in queſtion, or proceed againſt him for any thing which he had taken vpon him to do in the Papacie. Let him read alſo <hi>Seſ.</hi> 39. which inſued the depoſing of all the Popes vncertaine, where it commaundeth all future Popes within a time limitted,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17244:38"/>
to ſummon a generall Councell. And here let him marke, the wordes whereby it bindeth all Popes to the execution of it; let him then turne ouer to the <hi>Seſ.</hi> 44. where <hi>Martin</hi> the .5. after he is elected, executed the Decree: and let him obſerue the word <hi>Teneatur,</hi> which is both in the Decree of the Councell, and in the execution of it. Afterwardes in the laſt <hi>Seſ.</hi> the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>Lituania,</hi> made humble ſupplication to the Pope, that before the diſſolution of the Councell, a certaine Booke of a Frier call'd <hi>Iohn Falkembergh,</hi> might be condemn'd in publike Seſsion; otherwiſe, proteſting in the behalfe of their Maiſters, <hi>De grauamine &amp; de appellando ad futurum Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium.</hi> Neither did the Pope finde himſelfe any way agreeued at this proteſtation, nor the Councell thinke it ſtrange: and by the practiſe of this Decree, the Author may vnderſtand, how it may be from hence collected, that a Pope <hi>Canonnically</hi> choſen, and vndoubtedly accepted for Pope, is bound to the obedience of the Church, and of the Councell: which conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Author doth affirme cannot be collected from that Councell of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> and therefore let him compare the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, with the practiſe alleadged, and he ſhall ſee that <hi>Gerſons</hi> ſpeach deſerueth no reprehenſion.</p>
            <p>The third <hi>Obſeruation</hi> is, that the Decree can haue no further force, ſaue only for redreſsing of that Sciſme, becauſe it was the worke of a body without a head: but foreſeeing an Obiection that might be made againſt him, drawne from the confirmation of <hi>Martin</hi> the 5. the Author notes, that the Councell was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by the Pope onely, ſo farre foorth as the Actes were decreed <hi>Conciliariter:</hi> but this was not ſo, that is; vpon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation preceding, and with an orderly collection of the voyces of the Fathers. And where I pray you doth the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor finde, that this Decree was made without deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diſputation, or without collection of the Fathers voyces? Peraduenture he meanes, becauſe it is not ſet downe in wryting; by that reaſon in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> nothing was decreed <hi>Conciliariter,</hi> becauſe there is no mention made either of ſuffrages, or diſputations: So then though the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations wherevpon that Decree was made, were not ſet downe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17244:39"/>
in writing; yet it is to be beleeued that there were diſputations, and the rather for that the workes of very worthy men were written at that time of this ſubiect: amongſt which, that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Booke of <hi>Gerſon</hi> was one, <hi>De poteſtate Eccleſiaſtica, &amp; origine viris, &amp; Legum;</hi> as any man may knowe, who will read it. Moreouer, <hi>Gerſon</hi> in this conſideration doth declare, that this queſtion was very much diſputed, for that it was begunne in the Councell of <hi>Piſa,</hi> which was fiue yeares before that of <hi>Conſtance:</hi> And who then can doubt, but that in the Councell of <hi>Piſa,</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and in the <hi>interim,</hi> of thoſe fiue yeares, but that the difficulties were exactly conſidered, &amp; in the determination of it, the ſuffrages orderly collected. But if any man will read the confirmation of <hi>Martin</hi> .5. hee ſhall euidently perceiue, that <hi>Conciliariter</hi> doth not ſignifie that which the Author would haue it, but is an interpretatiue. In the 45. and laſt <hi>Seſsion</hi> of that Councell, it is ſayd; That the <hi>Maſſe</hi> and <hi>Letanie</hi> beeing ended, the Cardinall of <hi>S. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ito</hi> by the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Pope, and of the Councell ſayd; <hi>Domini ite in pace;</hi> wherevnto <hi>Amen</hi> was anſwered: and afterward a Biſhop, beeing by order from the Pope about to make a Sermon for the concluſion of the Councell: The Ambaſſadours of the King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> and of the great Duke of <hi>Lituania</hi> did demaund in the name of their Maiſters (as hath been already touched) that <hi>Falkembergh's</hi> Booke might be condemned in publike <hi>Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which was formerly condemned by thoſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>in cauſa fidei;</hi> and of the Nations, of the Councell, and of the Colledge of Cardinals: the <hi>Popes</hi> anſwere was, that he did confirme whatſoeuer the Councell had concluded, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, in matters of Fayth, <hi>Conciliariter,</hi> and not otherwiſe; whereby it doth appeare, that <hi>Conciliariter</hi> is appoſed to that which the Ambaſſadors had alleadged; Namely, that the Booke was condemned ſeuerally by thoſe that were deputed <hi>in cauſa fidei,</hi> by the Nations, and by the Colledge of Cardinals; and that <hi>Conciliariter</hi> doth ſignifie as much as if he ſhould haue ſayd, <hi>In publique Seſsion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let vs yet come ſomewhat nearer the matter: if this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of the <hi>Pope</hi> were giuen vpon ſome vnexpected propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17244:39"/>
happening, made after the end of the Councell; then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Councell approued before, neither was it the <hi>Popes</hi> intention to approue it. And if theſe Pollaxes had not profered this propoſition, the condemnation of <hi>Wickliffe</hi> and <hi>Huſse,</hi> had not been authenticall: and it will follow, that a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was accidentally confirmed: And yet this is as tollerable as many other thinges which are vſuall with our Author. That Councell was a body without a head, to conclude, that in the vacancie of the Chaire <hi>Apostolique,</hi> the Church is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnperfect, as beeing defectiue in ſome <hi>Eſsentiall</hi> part. After the death of <hi>Marcelinus,</hi> the Church continued ſeauen yeares &amp; a halfe, without a <hi>Pope,</hi> vnder <hi>Diocletians</hi> perſecution, as <hi>Damaſus</hi> doth teſtifie. And who will therefore affirme, that the Church was defectiue in ſome <hi>Eſsentiall</hi> part, in that time of ſo great perfection? I know that ſome men do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the vacancie had ſo long continuance; mooued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by ſome probable inducementes: But it is more credible, that <hi>Damaſus</hi> ſhould know the truth of it, being himſelfe a <hi>Pope</hi> 69. yeares, after the death of <hi>Marcelinus,</hi> and borne ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that vacancie; then wee in our time vpon vncertaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures: But let this be as it will; let vs ſpeake of things which are certaine.</p>
            <p>Vpon the death of <hi>Clement</hi> the fourth, in the yeare 1270. the Church was without a <hi>Pope</hi> wel-nie three yeares; Shall it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſaid, that the Church was all that while without a head? No, rather let vs hold the doctrine of <hi>S. Ciprian,</hi> and <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> 24 <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 1. <hi>C. Quodcun<expan>

            <p>The author concludeth his Diſcourſe of the inualiditie of this forenamed decree of the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> ſaying: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon afterwardes, <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, in the Councell of <hi>Mantua,</hi> doth excommunicate whomſoeuer ſhould appeale from the Pope to the Councell: Heere we are to obſerue, that there may be a <hi>Fallacie</hi> in the worde <hi>Onde.</hi> Wherevpon (for it may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) as though Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, did excommunicate ſuch appealance, becauſe the Pope is ſuperiour to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; but in the <hi>Bull</hi> it ſelfe, it is not ſayd ſo. It is true, that it prohibites ſuch appeales; but the reaſon is, becauſe they haue
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17244:40"/>
reference to that which is not, and of which there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie when it ſhall bee: In the meane time the poore are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the mightie, offences remaine vnpuniſhed, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is foſtered againſt the firſt ſea, it is free for euery one to offend, all Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, and <hi>Hierarchicall</hi> orders are confounded: where you may perceiue, that <hi>Pius</hi> 2. doth not alleadge his ſuperiority for a reaſon which had been an euident and pregnant argument, becauſe there is no appeale but to a Superiour.</p>
            <p>Let no man reply, that though it be not expreſſed, yet it may be collected out of thoſe wordes; for there is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoode that hee would ſo ſlightly paſſe ouer that which is moſt ſubſtantiall, and inſiſt with ſuch diligence vpon ſo many thinges, that are but accidentall. Beſides this, before he doth alleadge theſe cauſes aboue mentioned: he affirmeth that he omitteth others manifeſtly contrary to this corruption; which argueth that the cauſes alleadged, are the moſt principall; and that the others are of leſſe importance, and therefore that poynt of Superioritie is of no force in this place. Moreouer, theſe wordes of our Author, <hi>in the Councell of Mantua</hi> ſerue onely to abuſe the Reader; for it was neither done in a generall, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall, nor any other Councell at all. It is true that <hi>Pius</hi> the 2. was in <hi>Mantua</hi> (as it lay in his way) but he had no body with him, ſaue onely his owne Court; as by the wordes of the <hi>Bull</hi> it appeareth, which ſayth; By the aduice, and conſent of our reuerend brethren the Cardinals of the holy Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Prelates, with the Ciuillians, and Canoniſts which follow the Court. But yet that which followeth in the Author, is worſe: that <hi>Pius</hi> the 2. did excommunicate whomſoeuer ſhould appeale from the Pope to the Councell. And that <hi>Iulius</hi> the 2. did renew this Excommunication: and that all the Popes ſucceeding them haue done the ſame, in the <hi>Bull</hi> intituled, <hi>In Coena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> the 2. and that of <hi>Iulius</hi> the 2. and all the other <hi>Bulles</hi> of that title, were not extant; this Obiection would remaine vnanſwered: But I will maintaine, that no Pope did euer excommunicate for appealing to a Councell,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:17244:40"/>Vnleſſe it were to a future councell; all theſe Bulls may be ſeen and read. And becauſe <hi>Poenae ſunt reſtringende,</hi> No Canoniſt will ſay that <hi>appellantes ad praeſens concilium,</hi> when any ſuch is, ſhalbe exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by virtue of theſe Buls, this then will not ſerue him to proue that the Pope is ſuperiour to the councell. But why did the author leaue out the word <hi>futurum?</hi> If <hi>Gerſons</hi> interpreter had com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted ſuch a fault, what cenſure would haue beene thought ſeuere enough for him? the reaſon of <hi>Pius</hi> 2. is good againſt thoſe, which do appeale to that which is not, neither is it certaine when it ſhall bee, that is a future councell: but it is not good againſt appealing to a preſent councell, and this is the reaſon that all Popes haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated <hi>appellantes ad futurum concilium.</hi> Let not vs then leaue out the word <hi>futurum,</hi> howſoeuer our paſſions could bee conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to conceale it.</p>
            <p>After this digreſſion, the author returnes once againe into <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and ſaith that Pope <hi>Martin</hi> 5. with the conſent of that councell did ordaine that they which ſhould be ſuſpected of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſhould be interrogated whether they did beleeue that the Pope had the <hi>Supreame</hi> power in the <hi>Church</hi> of God: from whence he doth conclude, that the councell did intend the <hi>Superiority</hi> to be in the Pope, and that the decree in the 4. <hi>Seſ.</hi> is to be vnderſtood of a Pope vncertaine, according to his owne expoſition, for that otherwiſe the councell ſhould be contrarie to it ſelfe, but how this interrogation is vnderſtood, whereof the Pope and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel do make mention, let the author vouchſafe to peruſe the 8. <hi>Seſ.</hi> where, amongſt the 45. condemned errours of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> the 41. is <hi>Non eſt deneceſſitate ſalutis credere, Romana<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eccleſiam eſſe ſupremam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alias Eccleſias.</hi> The councell followeth. <hi>Error est, ſi per Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Eccleſiam intelligat vniuerſalem Eccleſiam, aut Concilium vniuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, aut pro quanto negaret primatum ſummi Pontificis ſuper alias Ecclesias particulares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This one point being read, doth make it manifeſt that the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> did intend that the Pope had the ſuperiority ouer all churches ſeuered, but not vnited. And here the author lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> walks another way,<note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note> and takes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to proue by authority of ſcripturs, by the conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of councels and by reaſon, that <hi>Gerſons</hi> opinion is manifeſtly erronius, ſaying.</p>
            <p>But laying aſide the councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> it is moſt eaſie to bee
<pb facs="tcp:17244:41"/>
proued by the authority of Scripture, by Councells and by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that <hi>Gerſons</hi> opinion is manifeſtly erronious. The Scripture doth no where giue authority to the Church, and to the councels aboue their Paſtors, much leſſe aboue the ſupream Paſtor, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, that Biſhops are ordained to gouerne the Church of God, appeareth <hi>Act.</hi> 20. where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that God hath placed Biſhops to gouerne the Church of God. And by theſe wordes of our Sauiour in the 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> where he ſaith to his Viccar, <hi>Super hanc Petram aedificabo Eccleſiam meam:</hi> where Chriſt making Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the foundation of his Church, did make him the head of that myſticall body, for that which a foundation is in reſpect of a houſe the ſame the head is in reſpect of the body, and we ſee that the head hath power ouer all the reſt of the body, but the reſt of the body hath no power ouer the head. In like manner <hi>Io.</hi> 21. when Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, Paſce oues meas,</hi> he made him ſheapheard ouer all his flocke; and doubtles the flocke hath no authority at all ouer the ſheapheard, but the ſheapheard ouer the flocke. Laſtly where as our Sauiour <hi>Luc.</hi> 12. <hi>Quis est fidelis diſpenſator &amp; prudens, quem conſtituit Dominus ſuper familiam ſuam.</hi> ſaith, Doubtleſſe hee doth declare that a Biſhop in his particular Church and the Pope in the church vniuerſall, is as it were, a high Steward in Gods family, and as the high Steward hath authority ouer the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>milie, and not the familie ouer him: ſo hath the Biſhop ouer his Dioces, and the Pope ouer the Church vniuerſall, and not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſe ouer the Biſhop, nor the Church ouer the Pope, though aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in a generall councell, and to this end it is that our Sauior in the ſame place addeth theſe wordes. <hi>Quod ſi dixerit Seruus ille in corde ſuo moram facit Dominus meus venire, &amp; coeperit percutere ſeruos &amp; ancillas, edere, &amp; bibere, &amp; inebriari; veniet Dominus ſerui illius in die qua non ſperat, &amp; diuidet eum, partemque eius cum infidelibus ponet.</hi> Out of which words it may be gather'd, that when the high ſteward of Gods houſe doth miſ-behaue himſelfe, it is not Gods pleaſure that the familie ſhould proceede againſt him; but reſerues to himſelfe, the power both to judge and puniſh him: ſo that according to the Scripture, the Church, and conſequently the Councell, which is a repreſentation of the Church hauing no power ouer the Pope, it followeth that it is vnlawfull to appeale from the Pope, to the Councell, but contrarily that it is lawfull to appeal from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to the Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:17244:41"/>There was no neceſſity of writing ſo much vpon this matter in regarde of thoſe few words wherewithall <hi>Gerson</hi> hath touched it and for my part I would forbeare to alledge that which <hi>Gerson</hi> &amp; others of the ſame opinion do anſwere,<note place="margin">Frier Paulo,</note> were it not that I woulde not interrupt the courſe which is begun of handling euery pointe in that order which is obſerued by the author.</p>
            <p>Firſt he affirmeth that the holy Scripture doth nowhere giue the Church power ouer the paſtours, much leſſe ouer the ſupreame paſtor, to this <hi>Gerſon</hi> anſwereth that our Sauior Chriſt ſent S. <hi>Peter</hi> to the Church when he ſaid vnto him <hi>dic Eccleſiae,</hi> for <hi>Gerſon</hi> in his time read the place according to the auncient <hi>Miſſall,</hi> and not according to the newly corrected. <hi>Reſpiciens Ieſus in diſcipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los ſuos, dixit Simoni Petro, ſi peccauerit. &amp;c.</hi> As the author may ſee both in his workes, as alſo in the text of the ſcripture which hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to this purpoſe. But to proue that the contrary is to bee founde in the ſcripture, the author doth alledge a place <hi>Act.</hi> 20. where S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that God hath placed the Biſhops to gouerne his Church, be it that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith ſo, although in truth there bee great difference betweene <hi>Poſuit vos Epiſcopos,</hi> and <hi>poſuit Epiſcopos.</hi> But though that bee granted he can conclude nothing out of this place that the Pope is aboue the Church no otherwiſe then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhop is. But from hence a man might ſtrongly conclude, that all Biſhops haue their authority immediately fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, which peraduenture would not be very pleaſing to our author.</p>
            <p>Who would euer haue inferred this conſequence? God hath placed Biſhoppes to gouerne his Church: <hi>ergo Papa eſt ſupra concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> but this had beene a ſtrong inference, God hath placed Biſhops to gouerne his Church, therfore if they do not gouerne it, they do not diſcharge that office whereunto they are aſſigned. This is a true propoſition God hath placed a King to gouerne a kingdome, doth it follow therfore that a king is ſuperior to his whol kingdom aſſembled together; the author anone will tell vs that it is no good conſequence and certainely it is not good neither in our authours opinion, nor in the opinion of <hi>Iohn Mariana</hi> the Ieſuit, but I may ſay truly that it holdeth not in all kingdomes.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place he alledgeth <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. <hi>Super hanc petram aedificabo Eccleſiam meam &amp;c.</hi> where he ſaith that Chriſt maketh <hi>Peter</hi> the foundation of his Church, which as <hi>Gerſon</hi> will not deny, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth that the Church is builded vpon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Apoſtles and Prophets. And in the <hi>Apoc.</hi> the wall of
<pb facs="tcp:17244:42"/>
Gods Citty hath twelue foundations with the name of the twelue Apoſtles, ſo he will not beleeue that the authour would condemne another expoſition which doth interpret <hi>ſuper hanc Petram</hi> vpon Chriſt and vpon the confeſſion of the faith of Chriſt, eſpecially ſeeing S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> admitting both the expoſitions doth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding allow beſt of the ſecond. By this it doth appeare that the authour vppon a place of ſcripture which hath two interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and both probable, will cull out that which ſerueth beſt for his purpoſe, and make it abſolutely a ground of an article. But becauſe it is true that <hi>Peter</hi> is a foundation, is hee therefore ſuperior to all the building? <hi>Gerſon</hi> will ſay, it followeth not, becauſe hee is not a principall foundation, but ſuch a one as is it ſelfe founded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, and not a totall foundation, but onely a twelfth part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning of the <hi>Apoc.</hi> And leſſe then a 25. parte according to the meaning of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; as concerning our authors compariſon, where he ſaith that when Chriſt maketh S. <hi>Peter</hi> the foundation of his Church, he maketh him the head of his Church, becauſe a foundation to a building is the ſame which a head is to a body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although it be true that S. <hi>Peter</hi> be a head, notwithſtanding the <hi>Analogie</hi> is not intelligible, <hi>viz.</hi> that there ſhould bee the ſame proportion betwixt a foundation, &amp; a building, as there is between a head and the body. I do not ſee where it is poſſible to finde any part of this proportion; who will ſay that as the foundation ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth the houſe (for that is the property of a foundation) ſo the head ſupporteth the body? this doth not hold. Againe who vvill ſay that as the head giueth ſenſe and motion to the body, that the foundation doth ſo likevviſe to the building; vvhat then doth it communicate? the propoſitions, that wee entend to eſtabliſh for doctrines, ought not to be grounded vpon ſimilitudes eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vpon ſuch ſimilitudes as are them ſelues grounded vpon ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, but why do we trouble our ſelues with the proofes, ſeeing we are both agreed of the concluſion that S. <hi>Peter</hi> is a head, but what then the <hi>Illuſtriſſ. Cardinall Pinelli</hi> is the head of the inquiſition, is he therefore ſuperiour to the whole congregation of the inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors being aſſembled? this followeth not in my vnderſtanding: vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like reaſon it is that <hi>Gerſon</hi> will not admit this propoſition <hi>viz.</hi> that the reſt of the body hath no power ouer the head, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being ſuch a head as the body it ſelfe hath conſtituted, but as

Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith that the ſupreame power of chooſing ſuch Prieſts as are worthie, and refuſing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy doth principally reſt in the people, and if the author will read the place he ſhall perceiue that hee ſpeaketh of Biſhoppes, particularly, though in the wordes alledged, he mentioned Prieſts, and withall, that it is not onely <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epiſtle, but the Epiſtle of 36.

contrarietie which ſeemeth to be betweene their words and their actions. The Pope denyeth the fact, the Councell doth examine witneſſes againſt him, and ſubſcribed to his condemnation: what needeth any more, but ſeeing the matter which was handled was a matter of infidelity, the <hi>Pariſians</hi> cannot conceiue according to the doctrine of thoſe times, why the Councell ſhould not haue to do with it, for if the words <hi>Prima ſedes a nemine iudicabitur,</hi> be to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in matter of hereſie, it is contrary to the doctrine of this time, if it be to be vnderſtood <hi>in aliis cauſis,</hi> it agreeth not with the purpoſe of the Councell.

Act whereof <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> is condemned for that hee with the whole ſecond councell of <hi>Epheſus</hi> tooke vpon them to cenſure the Pope of Rome: concluding that if that Patriarch which next to the Pope poſſeſſed the higheſt place in the Church toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a generall councell, had no power to iudge the Pope, it followeth that the councell is not aboue the Pope: Hereunto they of <hi>Paris</hi> do anſwere briefly that the ſecond councell of <hi>Epheſus</hi> which our author tearmeth a generall councell was onely a <hi>Conuenticle,</hi> and branded with the infamous ſurname of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datorium,</hi> and therefore in that third Act of <hi>Calcedon</hi> alledged by our author, <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> is condemned, not onely for the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating <hi>Leo,</hi> but alſo for receiuing <hi>Eutiches</hi> to the communion, whom his ordinary had excommunicated, for vſing violence to
<pb facs="tcp:17244:47"/>
               <hi>Flauian</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and for many other offences, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his contumacie which he vſed that day againſt the councell.</p>
            <p>If out of theſe premiſes any man will goe about to proue that a councell can not condemne a Patriarch of Conſtantinople, I will deny the conſequence, but this were a good conſequence, that therefore no Predatorie councell can condemn a Patriarch of Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtantinople, becauſe he holdeth the true catholique faith, and in like ſort it followeth that no Councell can proceede againſt the Pope in fauour of an hereſie, becauſe hee teacheth the catholique faith. There are ſome others who do obſerue that in that third act many complaintes were exhibited againſt <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> as well <hi>viua voce</hi> of them which were preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as vnder the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of others which were farre off. <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> though he were preſent in the citty, yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting himſelfe from the Councell, was at three ſeuerall times ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moned to appeare, which he vtterly refuſing to do, the Councel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to condemne him, in this condemnation. 186. Biſhops pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their ſentences, as it may appeare by the Acts of that coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell where theſe ſentences are formally ſet downe. The legate of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſaid thus that <hi>Dioscorus</hi> againſt the orders of the church taking vpon him the primacie had reſtored <hi>Eutiches</hi> that hee would not ſuffer <hi>Leos</hi> epiſtles to <hi>Flauian</hi> to be read &amp; that for theſe errors he might haue had his pardon, but for that he did afterward preſume to excommunicate <hi>Leo</hi> the Archbiſhoppe of great Rome and for that he was accuſed to the Councell of many hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and for that hee beeing thriſe ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moned refuſed to appeare, they in the behalfe of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> that holy <hi>Sinode</hi> and bleſſed Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did depriue him of his Epiſcopall dignity. <hi>Anatolius</hi> biſhop of Conſtantinople ſaid, I alſo am of the ſame opinion, and do aſſent to the condemnation of <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> for that he was diſobedient to the citation, but he made no mention of the excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Leo. Maximus</hi> of <hi>Antiochia</hi> said, I do concurre with <hi>Leo</hi> of Rome and with <hi>Anatolius</hi> of Conſtantinople in the depoſing of <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> for that beſide other thinges he diſobayed the citation. After theſe 184. Biſhops pronounced their ſentences ſucceſſiuely, and ſome of them ſaid, I condemne <hi>Dioscorus</hi> for his contumacie, others, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the voices of the three Patriarchs, others according to the ſentence of <hi>Anatolius,</hi> from whence they do gather that the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Dioscorus</hi> by the Concell was for diuers faults committed, whereupon he being called, refuſed to appeare. The excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17244:47"/>
of <hi>Leo</hi> which the Romanes did inſert amongſt the cauſes of his depoſing, aſſented vnto by ſome of the fathers, was not they ſay the generall ſentence of the councell and proue it as to them it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth manifeſtly. For the intimation of the ſentence againſt <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscorus</hi> is not in the Acts of the councell, but alledged by <hi>Euagrius</hi> in his lib. 2. chapter 18. where making a repetition of the cauſes of the condemnation, the excommunication of <hi>Leo</hi> is not to bee found.

            <p>And to make it appeare yet more plainly that the councell of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> was of a contrary opinion to that which the Author would father vpon it, they add that in the firſt Act of it, the <hi>Senators</hi> and the Biſhoppes beeing aſſembled in the preſence of the Emperour and the Empreſſe, the Emperour and the <hi>Senate</hi> ſitting in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Church and at his left hand the Popes <hi>Legates</hi> with <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolius,</hi> and the Biſhoppes vnder his iuriſdiction, at his right hand <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Iuuinall</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with their Biſhoppes, the Popes <hi>Legates</hi> went into the midſt of the councell and ſaid, that they had commaundement from the Pope of the citty of Rome, which is head of all the Churches, that <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> ſhould not ſit in the councell, wherefore they deſired, that <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> might depart the councell, or otherwiſe themſelues would goe forth of it, the Iudges, and the <hi>Senate</hi> demaunded what was obiected againſt <hi>Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus,</hi> one of the <hi>Legates</hi> anſwered that hee had aſſembled a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell without any authority from the Sea <hi>Apoſtolique,</hi> another of the <hi>Legates</hi> ſaide wee cannot tranſgreſſe the commandements of the moſt bleſſed Pope, and another of them ſaid we cannot endure ſo great an iniury that that Sea ſhould be Iudges. The Iudges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> ſhould ſit downe; and that all the reſt ſhould likewiſe ſit downe in their places. In the laſt Act alſo the fathers,

and the Iudges being ſet, the <hi>Legates</hi> of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> demaunded of the Iudges that they might haue leaue to ſpeak, which being graunted they ſaide, yeſterday after you departed and we followed you, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Acts were made in the councell which wee conceiue to bee contrary to the Canons, and to the deſcipline <hi>Eccleſiasticall,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee doe require that you cauſe them to bee read againe, to the intent that euery one may ſee whether they be iuſt: The Iudges commaunded that they ſhould be read, and accordingly a Canon was read, where it is ſaide that the auncient fathers haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great priuiledges to the Sea of old Rome, in regard of the Empire of that city, therefore alſo the ſecond councell of Conſtantinople, hath giuen as great priuiledges to the Sea of Conſtantinople, new Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> iudging that a city adorn'd with the Empire and <hi>Senate,</hi> ought to haue priuiledges and authority in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, equall to old Rome, and to haue the next place after her: The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non being read together with the ſubſcription, one of the <hi>Legates</hi> ſaid, you ſee with what ſubtilty, holy Biſhops are dealt with all, in that they haue bin enforced to ſubſcribe without producing the copie of the Canon whereof they haue made mention: The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops cryed out no man is enforced, and the contention being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted; the Iudges did order that both the parties ſhould propound the Canons; the ſixt Canon of the Nicene councel was read in the behalfe of the Romanes and in the behalfe of the Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; the reading was different; for in that which the Romans read, theſe words were in the beginning of it; <hi>Quod Eccleſia Romana ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per habuit primatum,</hi> which are not in the other copies, after this a Canon being read of the councel of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantinople, the Biſhops rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoned ſufficiently, &amp; finally the Iudges demanded of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what was their opinion; whereunto they anſwered that that which was deter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mined was iuſt, one of the Romane <hi>Legates</hi> did proteſt that either the decree might be annihilated, or that his proteſtation might be recorded againſt it, let the reader therefore Iudge what opinion the councell of <hi>Calcedon</hi> held of the Popes ſuperiority.</p>
            <p>As to the Romane councell vnder <hi>Simachus,</hi> the Pariſians doe not deny that the Popes of Rome haue held that they ought not to be iudged of any, &amp; alſo that the prouincial councels they haue aſſembled in Rome haue not confirmed the ſame, but they ſay with all that neuer any Roman councel, neither this fift nor any other
<pb facs="tcp:17244:48"/>
came to ſpecification that the Pope may not bee iudged of a general councel and when they ſay that the Pope can bee iudged of none, they vnderſtand that hee can bee iudged of none, that hath not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall authority in the Church. For the Pope hauing generall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it ſtands not with reaſon, that he ſhould bee iudged by him that hath but particular authority: wherewith they anſwere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the hiſtory which he alledgeth of <hi>Leo</hi> the third.</p>
            <p>But here I am inforced to ſet downe a little thing of mine own. <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi> in the third of his hiſtory reporteth this fact: Where yet it ſhal not be found that he ſaith, there being aſſembled a great councell of Biſhoppes, as the author maketh him ſpeake. He ſaith ſimply, firſt that <hi>Charles</hi> ſent <hi>Leo</hi> to Rome, with many Biſhoppes and ſecular noblemen: and enterteined himſelfe elſwhere about publique buſineſſe. Afterwarde hee went to Rome, and there heard the accuſations againſt the Pope: and hauing diligently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined them, hee required their opinion: and the Biſhops made anſwere, that it were well that the Pope ſhould iudge himſelfe: and it was acceptable to <hi>Charles</hi> to bee deliuered from proceeding to that iudgment. Let the author read the place, and hee ſhall ſee no mention there of a councell: and that it was rather a conuocation of the imperiall councell, where were both ſeculars and Biſhops: and that the Biſhops did fauour the cauſe of the Pope. And let the author alſo remember himſelfe, that hee oppoſed before againſt the decree of <hi>Constance</hi> becauſe there was no debaiting of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before hand: and let him not here plant ſuch a maine foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a thing which was ſpoken by ſome Biſhops in a particular fact, thus aſſembled, and hauing their opinion vnpremeditately demaunded. For peraduenture the Popes innocency being known vnto them, they ſpake by way of exaggeration: not therefore (will <hi>Gerson</hi> ſay) to the preiudice of generall councels, which repreſent the Church vniuerſall, and haue vniuerſall authoritie. But ſee Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cunning of our author: Who ſaith that the firſt councell of Rome vnder Pope <hi>Simachus,</hi> approued as their owne decree that ſentence of <hi>Ennodius, aliorum hominum causas &amp;c.</hi> It ſhall neuer bee found in that councell, that that ſentence was particularly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, no nor yet ſo much as mentioned. It will bee found indeede that the councell ſaide, let a little booke bee brought hether, which hath beene written by <hi>Ennodius,</hi> againſt them which haue mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured
<pb facs="tcp:17244:49"/>
againſt our fourth <hi>Sinod;</hi> and it beeing read, the councell ſaide, let the booke bee held of all men for moſt ſound and for <hi>Sino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical,</hi> and let it be entred amongſt the actions of our fourth and fift <hi>Sinods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Integerrime Synodaliter.</note> and let it be held as the other decrees of the <hi>Sinodal</hi> actions, becauſe it is written and confirmed with <hi>Sinodall</hi> authority. And Pope <hi>Simachus</hi> anſwered, bee it done according to your will, and bee it placed among the decrees Apoſtolicall, and held for ſuch.</p>
            <p>Here ſay the <hi>Pariſians</hi> that it is to be vnderſtood, that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees <hi>Synodall,</hi> or actions <hi>Synodal,</hi> or decrees <hi>Apoſtolicall,</hi> is not ment a <hi>Canon,</hi> which can determine an article, as <hi>de fide,</hi> that is, to bee held for matter of <hi>Faith.</hi> But all the Epiſtles of a Pope entred in the Regiſter, are called the decrees of ſuch a Pope: and hee that ſhall peruſe the book of Councells, ſhall ſee this inſcription vpon euery Pope, <hi>The decrees of Pope N.</hi> and then his election, his life, and afterward his Epiſtles if there be any. And likewiſe in the Councels he ſhall ſee, that their actions containe many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of interchanged ſpeaches; yea not fore-thought on, &amp; ſomtimes the epiſtles of ſundry perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: al which things are not <hi>de fide,</hi> neither doth any man receiue them for ſuch. No man can poſſibly ſay, that the Popes epiſtles, eſpecially before <hi>Siricius,</hi> nor all that which at this day is found contained in ſo many narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Actes of the councell of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enſuing, is <hi>de fide.</hi> The determinations of Councels are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, which in the auncient for the moſt part will not paſſe one or two ſheetes; whereas their actions will containe fortie or fifty. And concerning the <hi>Papall</hi> decrees, their greater part conteineth no other matter ſaue ſuch as doth not concerne the <hi>Faith.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a long epiſtle there ſhall be one onely Article, as in that moſt famous and moſt holy epiſtle of Saint <hi>Leo</hi> to <hi>Flauian.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is great ods to ſay, ſuch a propoſition of <hi>Ennodius</hi> was approued, which would intend that it were approued as an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of faith, or <hi>Ennodius</hi> booke was approued, which intends no more ſaue that it is a good book, &amp; made to good purpoſe, but not that whatſoeuer is in it, ſhould be <hi>de fide:</hi> &amp; to eſtabliſh well this anſwere, it might bee ſaid to the author: This booke is of many ſheets printed in <hi>folio,</hi> it conteineth aboue 200. Propoſitiones, among which that is one which the author produceth, It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded whether they will that they be all <hi>de fide:</hi> and it ſhall
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17244:49"/>
be ſhewed him that there is ſome there that is not ſuch, If he will not accept them all, as being <hi>de fide,</hi> what reaſon why hee would haue this to be <hi>de fide,</hi> and not the reſt? Hee hath thought to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape this obiection, by telling vs that one onely ſentence of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodius,</hi> was approued. Let vs ſpeake frankly, the pamphlet was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, wherein among many other, is this ſentence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more approued then the reſt; ſo that this ſhall be no more <hi>de fide</hi> then all the booke.</p>
            <p>Some alſo obſerue, that that fourth Councell, called <hi>Palmare,</hi> was aſſembled to giue an end to the imputations which were laid vpon Pope <hi>Simachus,</hi> which were not of matters concerning his gouernment, but of matters meerely perſonall, of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, &amp;c. as the Lord Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> doth well deduce: It was therfore intended by <hi>Ennodius,</hi> that ſuch like delights ſhold be remitted to diuine judgment, which thing alſo <hi>Gerſon</hi> and he that followeth his opinion doth admit. And that this is true in thoſe very Actes of the fift Councell, where <hi>Ennodius</hi> booke was approued, Pope <hi>Simachus</hi> thanking the fathers for their defending him, proceedeth on; that for the time to come he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deineth, that the like courſe be obſerued, not onely for the Biſhop of the Sea Apoſtolique, but alſo for all other Biſhops of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, for which without making new decrees, there are alrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy the auncient, that the ſheepe cannot reprehend their Paſtor, vnleſſe he be found in fault in matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> neither accuſe him for any matter vnleſſe it be for his injuſtice. The ſentence of <hi>Enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> is too generall, for by that it would ſeeme, that the Pope were not ſubiect to humane judgement, no not in caſe of Hereſie: for he ſaith abſolutely, that in all cauſes, he is reſerued to diuine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore wiſely Pope <hi>Simachus</hi> after he had ſaide that he extended the ſelfe ſame to all Biſhops, according to the auncient Canons, excluded the caſe of hereſie and of iniuſtice. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all this diſcourſing, the book of <hi>Ennodius</hi> placed among the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees Apoſtolicall hath this title: <hi>In the name of the Father, of the Son &amp; the holy Ghoſt,</hi> the preface of <hi>Ennodius &amp;c.</hi> and afterward, <hi>It was compoſed againſt them, which had preſumed to write againſt Synods; that neither againſt the Biſhop of the Sea Apoſtolique, nor any other Biſhop any man preſume ſuch matters as were preſumed againſt Pope Simachus.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Pariſians</hi> ſay, that this place ſerueth to proue the
<pb facs="tcp:17244:50"/>
doctrine of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> and doth in no wiſe croſſe it. It may well bee thought, that the author, as being of eminent learning, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued well the weakenes of his argument, and therefore made no mention, neither of the hiſtory nor of the <hi>Synod Palmare,</hi> nor of the approbation of the whole book of <hi>Ennodius,</hi> neither of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the caſe of <hi>Simachus</hi> to all other <hi>Biſhops,</hi> much leſſe out of the place alleged would draw any concluſion.</p>
            <p>As touching the eight Councell, it had beene better that the author, beſides his telling vs we read in the ſeuenth action, had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo whoſe the wordes were which hee hath read: for they are the words of <hi>Adrian</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſpoken in a <hi>Synod of Rome</hi> and rehearſed together with many other thinges. Vpon which not withſtanding the Councell determineth nothing. But wee reade in the Canons of the ſame eight councell determined, by it theſe words. <hi>Beſides if an Vniuerſall Synod ſhall be aſſembled, &amp; any ambiguity and controuerſie ſhall ariſe also concerning the holy Church of the</hi> Romans; <hi>it is meete with venerable reſpect and conuenient reuerence to inquire of the queſtion propoſed, and to receiue ſolution or to proceede and giue order, So yet as not audaciouſly to giue ſentence againſt the high Biſhops of the elder</hi> Rome. So that they allow of a ſentence not beeing audacious.</p>
            <p>There followeth another proof out of the Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> vnder <hi>Alexander</hi> the third in the chapter <hi>Licet de electione:</hi> Where a decree being to be made of the manner of chooſing the <hi>High Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> it ſaith that in this election, there muſt be vſed very eſpeciall diligence, becauſe if they commit error, there is no recourſe after to be had to any ſuperiour, there being none on earth ſuperior to the Pope. The Author hath handſomly added theſe wordes of his owne, <hi>There being none on earth Superior to the Pope:</hi> which are too ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant. That chapter of the Councell ſaith nothing elſe but that recourſe to a ſuperior cannot be had. It ſufficed to alledge vnto vs the bare words of the councell and not to add of his owne, as a matter out of the Councel juſt that which is in controuerſie. But this place maketh againſt our Author, hauing ſaid ſo often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that a doubtful Pope is ſubject to the councel, much the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more a Pope intruded. Where therefore it ſaith, if there bee error in the election, there is no ſuperiour, whom to haue recourſe vnto, it is not ment that the Councell is not Superior: nay, rather as well by his owne, as by the generall opinion, ſo often as there is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17244:50"/>
&amp; doubt, in the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth alwaies to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel. The meaning therfore of the ſaid chapter <hi>Licet</hi> is this, that there is no ſuperiour actually in being, by reaſon that the councel is not alwaies aſſembled, whence we ſee that the author contrary to his owne proper meaning, hath added here, <hi>there being on earth no Superior to the Pope.</hi> For whenſoeuer there is error or doubt of error in the election, himſelfe affirmeth that there is on earth a ſuperior to the Pope, and that this is the councell.</p>
            <p>To the councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> the Lord Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in the ſecond book, <hi>de auct. Concil. cap.</hi> 13. ſaith, that it hath moſt expreſſely defined this controuerſie, But becauſe ſome doubt whether the councell were generall, therefore the queſtion ſtands on foot ſtill euen among the Catholicks. And in the 17. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (it appeareth not whether to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntradict himſelfe or to confirm the ſame) he ſaith it is a doubt, whether the ſaide councell haue defined this thing as a decree of the <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi> It ſeemes therefore ſuperfluous to bring an authority againſt <hi>Gerſon,</hi> which ſuffereth (by the doctrine of himſelfe that bringeth it) ſo many perplexities: and doubt being alſo made of the authority of that councell, and withall of the determination. But <hi>Dominicus Soto</hi> ſpeaketh of it well and clearely, For <hi>lib. 6. de iuſt; &amp; iur: q.</hi> 1. <hi>a.</hi> 6. he diſputes againſt, the <hi>Monti di picta</hi> which are very expreſly approued in that councell, with theſe words, <hi>Sacro approbante Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio declaramus &amp; definimus Montes p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the ſaid <hi>Soto</hi> ſeeing how much this was againſt his opinion, who doth condemne them; makes anſwer that all the acts of that councell are not receiued, nor put in practiſe. But the <hi>Pariſians</hi> ſay moreouer, that in that Councell there were neuer preſent one hundred Biſhops, and particularly in that ſecond Seſſion here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged by the author, counting the Aſſiſtances in Coct, and the Titulars without dioceſſe, there were threeſcore and four Biſhops all in a manner of places round <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the decree. Now whereas in diſanulling it, anſwer is made to him that maintained it by virtue of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Baſill</hi> and it is ſaid that the councell it ſelfe was remoued by <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and that therfore it is of no validitie, ſeeing the Pope hath power to tranſfer the councels, as he that hath authority aboue them; this doth not appertaine to the ſubſtance of that Bull, but is an auoiding of a contrarie reaſon, and is not therefore a determination. For which cauſe very well the Lord Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in the ſecond place alledged, hath reuoked that which he had ſaide in the firſt: that is, that that councell hath moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly determined; and hath ſaid that it is in doubt, whether that be a determination.</p>
            <p>The common iudgement of all the divines is, that the reaſons which are vſed in a determination, are not intended themſelues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be determined. And it ſhould be a maruailous ſtrange matter that framing a decree of a particular thing, ſuch as is the reuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Pragmatick,</hi> which is no matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> an article of <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould incidentally be determined, ſo that the principall ſhould not be of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the acceſſary ſhould of neceſſity bee of <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pariſians</hi> adde farther, that to proue that the Biſhop of Rome hath authoritie aboue the Councell, there are brought in that place a number of hiſtories, not ſo few as fifteene, and laſtly the book of <hi>Aimarus de Synodis:</hi> whereupon we were to ſay, that all thoſe hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were <hi>de fide.</hi> And the Pariſians ſhew plainely, that ſome of thoſe hiſtories, recited faithfully, do ſay the contrary. But it woulde be too long here to produce ſo many particulars. Some alſo mak anſwere, that the Bull doth not ſay that the Pope hath authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Councels, but it ſaith that it is to be auerred out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſcriptures, and out of the ſayings of the Fathers, and Biſhops of Rome, and Canons &amp; Councels, that the Biſhop of Rome hath authority aboue the generall Councels: ſo that it is not intended to be otherwaies true, then ſo far forth as that auerment may be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Therefore firſt that proofe muſt be produced,<note place="margin">Quatenus inde conſtat.</note> and the ſenſe of the ſcriptures and ſayings of the Fathers muſt be ſeene: ſeeing the Councell doth not affirme it as of it ſelfe, but with reference, that is, ſo farre forth as the ſcripture and thoſe other thinges alledged make proofe thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:17244:51"/>An other doctor propoſeth another difficulty much greater, that in the beginning of the Bull of this Councell, it is ſaid, that Chriſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſors to be his vicars, vnto whom (as is teſtified in the book of Kings) obedience is ſo neceſſary, that hee which doth not obay, is to dye the death. Which if it bee an article of faith, is a very ſeuere one; that all diſobedience to the Pope ſhold be puniſhed with death. And certainely the worlde hath not receiued it, neither happily euer will. The ſame Doctor addes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he cannot conceiue how ſo many yeares before there was any Pope, there ſhould be ſpeech of him in the book of Kings. Afterward he ſaith, that he hath read all the 4. books of the Kings, and neuer yet found there any ſuch matter. But let vs leaue the authority of this Councell, ſeeing the Doctors which follow <hi>Gerſon</hi> do not receiue it: And each of the eight anſweres made vnto it, doth of it ſelfe diſſolue the argument.</p>
            <p>For a concluſion the author brings forth, as it were for an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi> a reaſon founded vpon the word of God, ſaying.</p>
            <p>But let vs ſee if the reaſon founded vpon the word of God,<note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note> doe teſtifie the ſelfe ſame verity. The holy Church is not like to the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> or of <hi>Geneua,</hi> or of other Citties, which conferre vpon their Duke that power which themſelues pleaſe; in regarde whereof it may be ſayde, that the Common-wealth is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Prince: neither yet is it like to an earthly kingedome, in which the people tranſfer their owne authority vnto the <hi>Monarck,</hi> and in certaine caſes may free themſelues from Royall dominion, and reduce themſelues to the gouernment of inferiour Magiſtrats; as did the <hi>Romanes,</hi> when they paſſed from dominion Royal to <hi>Conſulare</hi> gouernment. For the Church of Chriſt is a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect kingedome, and an abſolute Monarchie, which hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance vpon the people, neither from them had his originall; but dependeth onely vpon the diuine will. And I (ſaith Chriſt in the ſecond Pſalme) am conſtituted a King by him, ouer Sion his ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly mountaine. And the holy Angell ſaid to the virgin Luc. 1. Our Lord God ſhall giue him the ſeat of <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father, and he ſhall raigne in the houſe of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome there ſhalbe no end. And in a thouſand other places the ſame is read, And that this kingdome doth not depend on men, Chriſt ſheweth when he ſaith, you choſe not me, but I choſe you. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 15. And we ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:17244:52"/>
ackhowledge it, at what time we ſhall ſay, thou haſt made vs to our God a Kingdome. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5. And this is the cauſe why this kingdome is in the Scriptures reſembled to a family. Who is a faithfull and wiſe ſeruant, whom his Lord hath appointed ouer his family? <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. becauſe the father of a family doth not depend on the family, neither from thence hath his authority. Now this being moſt true there followeth thereof by neceſſary conſequence, that the Vicar generall of Chriſt doth not depend of the Church, but onely of Chriſt, from whom he hath his whole authority: as alſo wee ſee in earthly kingdoms, that the <hi>Viceroy</hi> hath not his authority from the kingdom but from the King, neither can be iudged or puniſhed by the people, but only by his Lord &amp; Maſter. Behold therefore how <hi>Gerſon</hi> is deceiued, and he alſo that doth follow him; and goeth con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarie to the doctrine of the holy ſcriptures, of the ſacred Councels, and of manifeſt reaſon.</p>

The <hi>Pariſians</hi> do anſwere, that thus the doctrine of the Catholiques doth hold; that God hath called the Church to the faith and his worſhip; and that he hath placed Chriſt ouer it for an head for euer: who firſt, himſelfe mortall, did gouerne it on earth with corporal preſence: but aſcended into heauen, doth rule it with inward influence &amp; aſſiſtance inuiſible vnto the end of the world. This is meant by, I am conſtituted a King by him. This meaneth that, our Lord God ſhall giue him the ſeat &amp;c. and hee ſhall raigne for euer. This is that, you choſe not me, but I choſe you. This is the kingdome in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> and thou haſt made vs to our God a kingdom. This Chriſt is the Father of the family, who is owner of it, and it his child and ſeruant. Which for that it is compoſed of viſible men, the Father himſelfe would that it ſhould bee gouerned alſo by a man viſible: and hath appointed the authority which hee ſhould haue; and inſtituted one of them before the Church was founded, but for the reſidue of time after it was founded hath left on earth the power to chooſe a ſucceſſour. Now with this doctrine, which I am aſſured the author will admit, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſay that without it no man is Catholique, the reaſon is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17244:52"/>
that the Church is not a commonwealth, as <hi>Venice,</hi> or as <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> which giue as much authority as themſelues pleaſe to their Duke; nor a kingdom, which may chaunge the manner of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, neither inuiſibly nor viſibly, becauſe that Chriſt hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the manner, much leſſe is it ſuch a kingdom as <hi>France,</hi> which hath a bloud royall, where the Kings ſucceede by birth, neither as ſome other by teſtament: but as touching the inward gouernment and meerely ſpirituall, it is not like vnto any, becauſe it hath a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and immortall King; In the viſible gouernment, it hath a Miniſter, as concerning his authority, inſtituted by Chriſt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depending of the Church, as concerning the application of the authority to the perſon, electiue and depending of it. Wherefore when he alledgeth, and I am conſtituted a King by him: Our Lord God ſhall giue him: you choſe not me: Thou haſt made vs to our God a kingdome: All theſe places and ſuch like others are meant of the inuiſible kingdom, the ſpirituall interior; where the Pope hath no gouernment at all, but onely the Sauiour which knoweth the hearts, and can inflowe into them, and beſtow on them the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and guifts, whereby they are made Citizens of the heauenly Ieruſalem. Chriſt alſo is that Father of the family, which depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds not of it. The high Biſhop is a ſeruant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>et ouer the family by the Fathers therof, in reſpect of the authority, but which the family it ſelfe hath placed ouer it ſelfe, in reſpect of the election of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. So as touching the authority, it is from Chriſt; as touching the application, it is from the Church. But the Author maketh the Church a family depending of the Father, whom he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be Chriſt: and this beeing ſetled, hee concludeth that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth not depend of the family, nor hath his authority from it: Therefore the Pope cannot be ſubiect to the Church: and paſſeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father of the family, which is Chriſt; to the ſteward elected by the family it ſelfe, which is the Pope. Let him ſtand firme in the ſimilitude, for he ſhal neuer find in the Goſpell, that any other is called father of the family, but God the father, or elſe Chriſt his Son by nature. The miniſter is a ſeruant, it is not fit to attribute the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of God to another: For which cauſe the example ſerues mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uailouſly for <hi>Gerſon,</hi> as alſo the example which the author brings of a <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> is much for the ſame purpoſe If a King of <hi>France,</hi> as S <hi>Lewis</hi> the 9., ſhould go to the conqueſt of the holy land &amp; ſhold ſay

This is that which <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon</hi> teacheth throughout all his works, where it is ſeene that verily the force of the reaſon concludeth for him. Out of the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boueſaid, I will not conclude, that the opinion of <hi>Gerſon</hi> in this point of the ſupreame power Eccleſiaſtical, either is true or is falſe, but onely that the authors concluſion that <hi>Gerſon</hi> is deceiued, and that he is deceiued that doth follow him, and goeth contrary to the doctrine of the holy ſcriptures, of the ſacred Councels, and of manifeſt reaſon, hath need of other proofes, then thoſe aboueſaide. The Author proceedeth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note>And if he ſhould ſay, that which <hi>Gerſon</hi> himſelfe wont to ſay, that it is written in Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> in the 18. chapter, tell the Church And if hee will not heare the Church, let him bee to thee as the Heathen and the Publican: I would anſwere, that in that place, by the Church is ment the Prelate, who is the head of the Church and ſo doth Saint <hi>Iohn Chryſoſtom</hi> expound it, <hi>Homilia</hi> 61. in <hi>Mathew</hi> and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. cap. <hi>Nouit, de iudiciis,</hi> and ſo doth the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize of the vniuerſall Church of all the world, and of all times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare; that he who will denounce a ſinner to the Church, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this precept, doth not aſſemble a Councell, but hath recourſe to the Biſhop or to his vicar.</p>
            <p>It is not ſufficient to the Author, to haue diſputed with <hi>Gerſon,</hi> but he alſo giues ſolution to his reaſons. But in this place, of many which <hi>Gerſon</hi> bringeth and deduceth,<note place="margin">Frier Paolo.</note> the author contenteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to produce one onely, and to diſſolue it: And this is taken from the authority of Saint <hi>Mathew:</hi> tell the Church, vnto which hee anſwereth the Church, that is the Prelate: and of this expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee maketh <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> the author: although the <hi>Pariſians</hi> ſay that <hi>Chryſoſtom doth</hi> not ſay ſo; but it ſeemes when a thing is accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to bee alleadged, euery man alleadgeth it without once viewing it. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> expoundeth, tell the Church, namely the Biſhoppes and Praefidents. This is that which <hi>Gerson</hi> ſaith, to the Church repreſentatiuely: becauſe it being not poſſible to aſſemble
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17244:53"/>
the whole, it be comes repreſented by the aſſembly of Biſhops and Praeſidents. And therefore they adde, that vnder the name of the Church, their cannot bee ment one perſon: For in vaine ſhould that enſue, If two of you ſhall conſent vpon earth concerning eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing whatſoeuer they ſhall aske, it ſhall bee done to them of my Father which is in heauen. For where there bee two or three gathered in my name, there am I in the midſt of them. And for confirmation of this ſenſe, they bring that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the information againſt the inceſtuous, there is plainely heard fornication among you &amp;c. It followeth, I indeede, abſent in body but preſent in ſpirit, haue already iudged, as preſent, him that hath ſo doone, in the name of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> you beeing gathered together and my ſpirit, with the vertue of our Lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> to deliuer ſuch an one to <hi>Satan,</hi> Where they note that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was then in <hi>Philippi,</hi> did not write by his Briefe, I excomunicate ſuch an one: but wrote to the Church, that beeing gathered together with his ſpirite, they ſhould do it. It is not therefore repugnant to <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> that to the Biſhops and Praeſidents, may bee alſo ment of a generall councell Aboue there was alſo propoſed the doubt, that tell the Church, were as much as to ſay tell thy ſelfe. As touching the practiſe, which ſheweth that tell the Church doth meane the Prelate, becauſe recourſe is had to the Biſhope or his Vicar: of the auncient practiſe, I haue ſpoken to him with the authority of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> as touching the modern, it is true that at this day the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhope or his Vicar excommunicateth without the aduiſe or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of any; many times alſo the Regiſter onely; and (that which is more important,) by authority delegated, a Clerke of the firſt tonſure deputed commiſſary in ſome very light particular cauſe, doth excommunicate a Prieſt.

of the natiuity, is not incurred by him that payeth it not, no not in many moneths and yeares after, if the creditor thereof would not haue it incurred.

Theſe are the practiſes which are now in vſe: of which I ſay nothing elſe, but that they growe from the interpretation which the author doth approue.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gerſon:</note>The ninth conſideration is, that contempt of the keyes is not incurred, when the Pope doth moſt enormouſly and moſt ſcandalouſly abuſe his power.

               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note> as though it did vſe to abuſe in ſuch ſort the keyes of the kingdome of Heauen.

            <p>Here it is moſt eaſie to defend <hi>Gerſon:</hi> ſeeing hee that handles that which falleth out in a caſe poſſible, yea and ſuch as hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened;<note place="margin">Frier Paolo.</note> doth not wrong them which doe well, but notes them that doe ill.

Whoſoeuer ſhall read Saint <hi>Bernard de conſideratione ad Eugenium,</hi> wil not finde fault with foure wordes in <hi>Gerſon;</hi> and that conſidering his conſiderations are in a neceſſary cauſe.

Hee cannot receiue iniury from the truth, that doth not ground him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon falſhood.</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe that it is true in it ſelfe, but like to the arts of the moderne hereticks, as though <hi>Gerſon</hi> now an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth and fifty yeares ſince could haue learned of the moderne hereticks. This is like to the prohibiting of the vſe of the diuine ſcripture, becauſe the hereticks ſerue their turnes with it. That the conſideration is true in it ſelfe, and that the Venetians ought to abhor it, ſeemeth no very good doctrine to teach to abhor the truth, and a truth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the maintenaunce of the liberty and power which God hath giuen them. Now the laſt part where the author ſaith, that they ought to puniſh ſuch defenders, is not well vnderſtood. I defend at this preſent the innocency of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> but I know not who were his defenders when the author wrote. Beſides that to pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſh the defenders of truth, ſeaſonably ſpoken, and in a neceſſary cauſe, is not wont to be done by any juſt and godly prince, and eſpecially by that commonwealth, which hath euer profeſſed the Catholicke truth.

Likewiſe, when one is forced by his ſuperior, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eccleſiaſticall or Secular, to make reſtitution to another, of his goods, or of his good name, or to keep faith &amp; his promiſes it cannot be ſaide that he who ſo is forced may reſiſt with force, &amp; turn himſelf againſt his ſuperior: and to paſſe ouer infinite other examples, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſomtimes the Magiſtrates or Princes impoſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens vpon the people, and conſtraine them to pay them. I trowe they would not be pleaſed, that any ſhould teach the people to raiſe rebellion vnder colour that <hi>vim vi repellere licet.</hi> And what great confuſion would there be in houſes, and in citties and in kingdomes, if to euery force, force might bee oppoſed, with ſaying that it is lawfull, by naturall reaſon to make reſiſtance with violence to violence? But if we ſpeake of the force which Prelates do vſe, when by the cenſures they conſtraine their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to obey, certaine it is that it is not lawfull, to make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with force. For if he who will not heare the church, ought to be vnto vs, according to the commaundement of the Lord, as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17244:55"/>
a Gentile and Publican: certainely he who with force will reſiſt the church, ought to be vnto vs worſe then Gentile &amp; Publican. And as for recourſe to ſecular Princes in matter of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, the ſacred councell of Trent hath already prouided expreſly, <hi>Seſ.</hi> 25. <hi>cap,</hi> 3. forbidding Secular Princes, that they hinder not Prelats ſo that they may not excommunicate, neither commaund that the excommunicationes already gone forth be reuoked, conſidering that this is no part of their office. Laſtly if wee come to the buſineſſe which is at this day in hand, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all purpoſe to produce that principle, <hi>vim vi repellere licet.</hi> For the force which our Lord vſeth to the common wealth of Venice, is a fatherly and iuſt force, conforming to the ſcriptures and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred canons, &amp; vſed in all times by the Prelats of holy church, and the remedie is plaine and ready, without recourſe to force or to help of Princes; namely Obedience and Humility, without which all other remedy is vaine.</p>
            <p>In the tenth conſideration,<note place="margin">Frier Paolo.</note> if to ſay that to the force of prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded ſentences, reſiſtance may by law of nature be made by force, bee a doctrine pernicious, then hath Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> taught a pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is not true that infinite ſcandals may grow out of this doctrine, nay rather it ſhall be ſaid that out of the contrary, they would ariſe indeed, for ſo ſhould Tirany be brought into the church, which as a publicke fault is more pernicious. Euen as no more true is it that by this doctrine there wold grow confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in houſes and citties becauſe euery one might defend himſelf from the Sergeants, from the Comito in Gallies, and from the Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For two which ſtriue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot both haue right on their ſides: but neades muſt it bee that if he which vſeth force, do it lawfully, the defence be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and where the defence is lawfull, the force muſt needs be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17244:56"/>The Author knoweth very well, though here he diſſemble it, that when the law ſaith <hi>vim vi repellere licit,</hi> it meaneth of that force which is vniuſtly vſed. And therfore the vniuerſal is not true which he draweth, when he ſaith if to euery force, force might be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: neither the law nor <hi>Gerſon,</hi> nor any man elſe hauing ſaid that all force may be by force reſiſted. The conſequence therefore of the Sergiants, and of the Cometo, and of the Prince who leuyeth iuſt impoſitions, doth not follow: neither that of the magiſtrate, who condemneth to reſtitution of goods or good name, or to keep his promiſes, becauſe theſe are lawfull forces. The conſequence which he deduceth of the force which the Eccleſiaſticall vſeth, is well to the purpoſe, when he intermedleth in cauſing to make reſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of goods, good name, or performing of promiſes; which are thinges appertaining to the <hi>Seculare,</hi> in which the Eccleſiaſticall hath not to intrude himſelfe, ſaue onely in <hi>foro paenitentiae</hi> in auricular confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But whenas the author ſaith, that if wee ſpeake of the force which Prelates do vſe, when by the Cenſures they conſtraine their ſubiects to obay; certaine it is that it is not lawfull to make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with force: For if he who will not obey the Church, ought to be as a <hi>Gentile</hi> and <hi>Publican:</hi> ſo much worſe he that will make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance with force: here he ſpeaketh either vniuerſally of all cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, comprizing alſo thoſe which are not of validitie; or elſe only of thoſe which haue validitie. If he ſpeake of all, and it be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors meaning, that to make reſiſtance to Cenſures which are nul, be worſe then to be a Gentile; it is a doctrine abſurd, falſe, erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and contrary to the law of nature, and to the doctrine of the foreſaid Cardinalles, and of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe: but if he meane of them onely which haue validitie, it is exceding good doctrine, and not contrarie to <hi>Gerſon</hi> yea rather confirmed by him. For <hi>Gerſon</hi> in the conſideration ſpeaketh of pretenſed cenſures, which are not iuridicall, but violences, &amp; if any aſſemby pronounce forth ſuch, it is not called together in the name of Chriſt, neither is Chriſt there preſent; and he that doth not heare it, is a good Chriſtian: &amp; ſo teach the Canons which are cited by <hi>Gratian.</hi> 11. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3.

About which we muſt ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e yet one word, to the end we reſt not deceiued with the ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the word, according to cuſtome. For immediately doth not ſignifie a thing indiuiſible: but it is meant according as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is ſpoken of, doth require. For if a Prince haue a fort ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed; he ſhall recouer it immediately, although hee haue neede of a yeare to ſet an armie in order: yea he ſhall do it immediately, if he ſhall haue neede to make his leagues and other agreements, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſhall ſpend many yeares.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt alſo take heede of the ambiguity of the ſecond limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; that there be no other remedie. For it by other remedy hee meane a lawfull remedie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if by remedy, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor mean a remedy preiudiciall to the part grieued; then al forces vniuſt haue other remedy then to reſiſt, and that is to ſupport them and take all patiently. But to this ſort of remedy is no man bound: yea rather oftentimes a man ſhould ſinne in vſing it, namely when the remedy were not onely preiudiciall to himſelfe, but alſo to an other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> See Reader how with an artificiall ambiguity hee endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to tranſport thee. Firſt he ſaith that the proportion is true, with limitation that there be no other remedy: and afterward ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long ſpeeches interpoſed, hee ſaith the Common-wealth of
<pb facs="tcp:17244:57"/>
               <hi>Venice</hi> hath a remedy at hand, without recourſe vnto force, or to the aid of other Princes, and that is obedience. Very well. This is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, but preiudiciall, and not onely to the liberty which GOD hath giuen them, but alſo to the life, goods and honour of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iects. Therefore they are not bound to vſe it: and by reaſon of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicing another, they ſhould ſinne if they ſhould vſe it. Whether then all other remedy be vaine, as the Author telleth vs, it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely to God to diſpoſe thereof, and to the euent to make it manifeſt. The Author ſhalbe beſought not to deliuer his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the time, leſt it be ſaid to him. To mee it is a thing of leaſt account to be iudged of you or of mans clay. That the force which the Pope vſeth is iuſt and fatherly, according to the firſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation; this is the point in controuerſie, and which ſhould haue beene handled, but the Author paſſeth it ouer with a bare affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Wee cannot ſee to what ſcripture the Author ſaith it is conforming. It is not according to the 13. Chapter to the Romains nor to the 3. of the Epiſtle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> nor to the ſecond of the firſt of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor to the 22. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> nor to the twelue Canons which treate of this matter. 11. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. That it hath beene vſed in the Church at all times, we ſee not before the yeare of Grace one thouſand. True it is that after that it hath beene ſometimes put in practiſe by the Biſhops of Rome: but alwaies due reſiſtance hath beene made them, whenſoeuer they haue abuſed their lawfull pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er. Wee muſt not conſider what opinion hath remained with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity concerning the actions of thoſe times; becauſe that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth often from the affection of the writers. And God by his moſt ſecret iudgements doth ſometimes permit, that the iuſt cauſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the weaker in the opinion of men. But the reſiſtance which <hi>Philip</hi> the faire made to <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. and <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth to <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the ſecond, like to that which this commonwealth doth vſe at this preſent, is well commended by <hi>Lodouike Ricbehome</hi> Prouinciall of the Ieſuites, in his Apologeticall in the 25. Chapter, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for an example to be imitated. Yea in the 24 chapter he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth, that whenſoeuer any Biſhop of Rome ſhould offend the King of France, as thoſe Kings were offended by thoſe Biſhops; the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites in ſuch occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold do that which the Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did in thoſe times, who vnited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with their king to the defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ieſty. I know not with what form of ſpeech to a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer the laſt parcel
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17244:57"/>
where he ſaith that there is another remedy for this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwelth beſides reſiſtance. For reading ſuch words he had put me in great hope that all this ſo great tumult ſhould ſodainely ceaſe. But when he commeth to explicate his meaning, I could not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but merauaile at it: becauſe this is a remedy in like ſort for him that ſhall bee aſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with force of armes to take from him that he hath, namely to yeeld and to giue him whatſoeuer he liſt to haue. Obedience is one of thoſe words which we tearmed ambiguous: and here with his comlines and faire ſhew it doth deceiue vs. Obedience ſeemeth an holy thing, and ſo is it when it is yeelded to a iuſt and honeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, but when it is referred to a tirannicail and abuſiue pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not good; but naturall defence doth then ſucceede in his place. God hath beſtowed liberty on the Commonwealth of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> and commaunded them to preſerue it, and to protect their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and not ſuffer them to be harmed. If one command them to reuoke the lawes needfull for this effect, and not to defend the life, goods, and honour of their ſubiects, but onely againſt ſuch as it plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth him to allow: if the common wealth ſhould yeelde to this, it would be an obedience in name, but in deeds an extreame diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God. This commonwealth hath alwaies obeyed the Eccleſiaſticall power in iuſt things, it hath alwaies reuerenced, aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and increaſed it: and we truſt in God that it will ſo continue he giuing them grace to do the ſame for euer: and that he will cauſe by his omnipotent vertue, that the preſent tempeſt ſhall end in fair weather, with great ſatiſfaction of the holy ſea Apoſtolique, and of this Common wealth no leſſe. We are not alſo to omit here an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation which the Author doth giue of a decree of the holy Counſel <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 25. cap 3. very different from the true meaning. The Councell ordaineth that the Secular magiſtrats ſhal not forbid the Eccleſiaſtical to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate any, nor cauſe them to reuoke their excommunication already thundered vnder pretext not to haue the things contained in that decree obſerued. And the Author ſaith the ſacred Councell of Trent hath prouided expreſſely, forbidding Secular Princes that they hinder not the Prelates, ſo that they may not excommunicate, nor command that the excommunications al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gone forth be reuoked. Now this is not the meaning of the Councell. For firſt he concealeth the condition which followeth that is, vnder pretext not to haue the preſent decree obſerued:
<pb facs="tcp:17244:58"/>
which as we haue ſhewed before, doth not forbid that it may bee done for ſome other cauſe. Then becauſe the Councell ſaith, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer Secular Magiſtrate; and our Author altereth it, ſaying ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Princes. But euery lawyer will tell him, that in odious matter, the name of magiſtrate comprehendeth not the Prince. Next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Councell ſpeaketh of a prohibition and commaund iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall: and our Author bringeth it againſt reſiſtance naturall, which he himſelfe in the place alledged, lib. 2. <hi>de Rom. Pont.</hi> cap. 29. hath denyed to be an Act of Iuriſdiction. So that to alledge that place of the Councell to the matter now in hand; is threefoldly to falſifie the meaning of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gerſon.</note>The eleuenth conſideration is, that contempt of the keyes is not incurred, when ſome Lawyer or Diuine in his conſcience doth ſay, that ſuch kinde of ſentences are not to bee feared: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if due information bee obſerued with warineſſe that no ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall thereon enſue to the weake; who repute the Pope for a God, who hath all power in Heauen and in earth &amp;c. This conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſpeake modeſtly of it,<note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note> is very little conſiderate. For <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſhould haue ſaide at leaſt, that an ignorant perſon, in doubtfull matters, might relie himſelfe vpon the iudgement of a Diuine or a Lawyer that caryed a name of great learning and honeſty. But that hee may relie himſelfe vpon what Diuine or Lawyer ſo euer, eſpecially in matter of obedience to the High Biſhoppe, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great raſhneſſe. For it is not doubtfull, but moſt certaine, that in doubtfull thinges a man is to obey his ſuperior. And then onely hee is not to obey, when it is cleere and certaine that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour commaundeth thinges contrary to the commaundement of God. And beſides, how many Diuines and Lawyers may a man finde, that through ignorance or malice may bee deceiued? And if one teach thee one way, and an other the contrary; on whom wilt thou relie? Secular Princes would in no wiſe ſuffer, that when they haue paſſed a ſentence, the party condemned might excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from obeying it, becauſe a Lawyer or a Diuine hath told him that in his conſcience that ſentence were not to be performed. How much leſſe then ought this to bee ſuffered in caſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Vicar of Chriſt; to whome all Chriſtians by the law of God are bound to be ſubiect and obedient?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Frier Paolo</note>In this eleuenth conſideration, the Author modeſtly maketh
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17244:58"/>
an invectiue againſt <hi>Gerſon;</hi> wiſhing that at leaſt wiſe he had ſaide, that an ignorant perſon, in doubtfull matters, might relie himſelfe vpon the iudgement of a Diuine or a Lawyer that caryed a name of great learning and honeſty: as though any man euer went to a Counſellor for a matter certaine. Be a man as ignorant as it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bee, hee will neuer aske counſell nor enter into conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, about that which hee holdeth for certaine and out of all queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Author afterward doth not conteine himſelfe within thoſe bounds of modeſty, which he promiſed in the beginning: and ſaith, that it is exceeding great raſhneſſe to ſay, that hee may relie himſelfe vpon what Diuine or Lawyer ſoeuer: as though it were ſaide in the tranſlation vpon whomſoeuer, or in the Latin <hi>cuilibet.</hi> But <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaith <hi>aliquis</hi> in the Latin, and the tranſlation ſaith <hi>Some.</hi> That whomſoeuer, ſeemeth to ſignifie be he who he liſt be, either learned or ignorant, a man of conſcience or conſcienceleſſe: which is not to bee ſo vnderſtood. For he that ſendeth a man to one as to a Counſellor, intendeth to addreſſe him alwayes to ſuch an one, as hath knowledge ſufficient of that which is to bee aduiſed on And <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth expreſly ſo deliuer, when he ſaith ſome Lawyer or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine in his conſcience. Conſcience (eſpecially with <hi>Gerſon</hi>) includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knowledge and honeſty; whereof there is a tract of his extant to bee ſeene. Therefore when <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaith, that he may relie vpon the conſcience of a Lawyer or a Diuine; hee meaneth of one held to bee of ſufficient honeſty and knowledge. And this ought not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the author, becauſe the new writers alſo, ſuch as are counted the beſt learned doe maintaine the very ſame opinion. And here it ſhall ſuffice me to alledge vnto him <hi>Nauar;</hi> who vpon the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>cum contingal; de reſcript: Rem.</hi> 2. <hi>Num.</hi> 30. ſaith formerly. Ninth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is inferred, that the Canons of the Church B. ſecurely might and ought communicate in Diuine duties with the foreſaide E. v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that reaſon, that hee who doth anie thing following the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Doctor famous for his learning and godlines of mind, is excuſed, though perhaps that fall not to bee right done, and though other ſhould hold the contrary. He alleadgeth many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors vpon this point; and proceedeth, which alſo they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſufficiently, to bee particularly of force to excuſe from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of Cenſures. And for this point alſo he alleadgeth many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I will not forbeare to add here alſo, that thoſe wordes, when
<pb facs="tcp:17244:59"/>
ſome Diuine or Lawyer &amp;c. ought to bee taken, either ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or collectiuely, according to the waightineſſe of the matter: ſo that in ſome caſe the counſell of one will ſuffice; and in an other caſe is to bee ſought the counſell of two, and three and foure; and in ſome perhaps an hundred mens counſaile ſhall bee requiſit. In this preſent controuerſie, (though for the matter it bee eaſie and cleere,) this Common-welth hath taken the counſell of manie, both within Italy &amp; without: ſo that he needeth not to inſiſt vpon that worde <hi>Some.</hi> But the author would ſhew, that in matter of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Pope, no recourſe at all ought to bee had to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors: becauſe in thinges doubtfull, wee are to obey our ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Which reaſon doth proue, that wee may neuer in any caſe haue recourſe to a counſellor: becauſe in a caſe doubtfull, we muſt chuſe the ſecure part; and who ſo maketh that choiſe, ſhalbee free from fault and error: and therefore wee muſt neuer take counſell at all. Here wee may not ſuffer our ſelues to be deceiued by ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of the word doubtfull. But wee muſt ſay, as wee haue before ſhewed, that doubtfull, is taken in two ſorts; either doubtfull bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore counſell; or ſo that after all diligent aduiſe it ſtill remaine doubtfull. In the firſt caſe I ſay, that it is a ſinne to obey our ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior; becauſe it is a caſting of our ſelues into hazard to goe againſt the law of God: but in the ſecond caſe I agree, that where doubt is, the ſuperior muſt bee obeyed: a thing which doth not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way counſell, but preſuppoſeth it rather. And the reaſons enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherewith the Author proueth the ſame, haue the ſelfe ſame fault. As when hee ſaith, how many Lawyers may one finde, that through ignorance or malice may bee deceiued? This falleth not out onely in caſes of obedience to the High Biſhoppe, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in all doubts: ſo that a man ſhould at no time take any aduiſe. Hee proceedeth, and if one teach thee one way, and another the contrary; on whome wilt thou relie? It may happen out in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that one may aduiſe one way, and another man another way. On whom ſhall a man relie then? All reaſons which conclude more then is propoſed, are fallacies. The Diuines which write of caſes of conſcience, make anſwere, that if a man ſhall bee in the wrong, hauing vſed all diligence that he poſſible can, hee ſhal be excuſed; ſeeing his ignorance is inuincible. It may bee that a Lawyer or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine whome I conſult with, by ignorance or malice may deceiue
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17244:59"/>
me. If I vpon ſufficient probable grounds ſhall haue beleeued that he was a man of knowledge and honeſty; I ſhall be excuſed. If one ſhall teach me contrary to another; then either will I relie vpon him whome I conceiue to be more excellently qualified; or elſe I will proceede on to take further aduiſe, till ſuch time as I ſhall bee throughly cleered, and my conſcience ſhall be aſcerteined.</p>
            <p>I ſee not now how the authors reaſon doth auaile when he ſaith that ſecular Princes would not ſuffer that the partie condemned might excuſe himſelfe from obeying any of their ſentences, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Lawyer or a Diuine, hath told him in his conſcience, that that ſentence is not to bee performed: How much leſſe ought this to be tolerated in matter of obedience to the viccar of Chriſt. Here firſt of all euery man muſt obſerue, that <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaith not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that a Chriſtian doth not incurre contempt of the keis; whenſoeuer a Diuine or Canoniſt in his conſcience doth ſay, that the ſentence ought not be performed: but this is meant only then, when the caſe is doubtfull, and in ſuch ſort doubtfull, that the partie cannot by himſelfe be reſolued of it. For if that which the Prelate commaundeth bee of thinges cleere in themſelues, or wherein a man may be cleared, without difficulty; there were no neede of any aduiſe. As if the Prelate ſhould commaund to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid blaſphemie or adulterie, it were not to moue doubt whether obedience were due. As alſo when a ſtate is interdicted for a cauſe notorious to all men to be vniuſt (as now wee preſuppoſe, and elſewhere haue proued, that that is for which at this preſent they will that the ſtate of <hi>Venice</hi> ſtand interdicted) there needs not any counſell, the caſe being cleare that no man ought obey. But ſpeaking onely of caſes doubtfull, I ſay that the authors argument from the ſentences of ſecular Princes to thoſe of the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Prelate, proceedeth neither from the place <hi>a pari,</hi> nor <hi>a mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi> For the diuine Scripture, which hath ſpoken both of the one and of the other hath not ſaide the ſame thing of both: but of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Prelates, it hath ſaid to the <hi>Hebrues:</hi> obey your ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, for they watch for your ſoules to render an account of them: But of obedience due to Princes, it ſaith to the <hi>Romans,</hi> it is neceſſary to be ſubiect not onely for wrath but for conſcience. My Prelate is not to commaund mee, ſaue onely thoſe thinges, which pertaine to my ſoules health, for this is that which he wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb facs="tcp:17244:60"/>
for. Howbeit though one watch for my ſoule, yet am not I therefore to ſleepe, but watch to my vtmoſt power. For Chriſt ſo commaundeth mee: and it is fit for mee to take heed that the Prelate watch ouer no other thing ſaue over the ſoule, nor that he ſleepe, or thinke that he watcheth when he dreameth And if my owne watchfulnes bee inſufficient, I will deſire my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour whom I thinke not to bee drowſie, to help mee and watch with mee, ſo that when I ſhall be doubtfull, whether my Prelate watch or ſleepe I will runne to counſell. But the Prince watcheth to exerciſe juſtice, as the miniſter of God, ſo that he will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with matters that belong to the ſoule, but to things temporal. Therefore I will not watch here, nor trouble my thoughts about it, but I muſt obey him firſt for wrath, then for conſcience ſake. True it is, that if the Prince, interuerting order, ſhould command mee ſomething in matters pertaining to my ſoules health, as if he commaunded mee to belieue or not beliue ſome article, I would thinke vpon it, and examine it according to the law of God, and if I doubted leſt it were preiudiciall to my ſoule, I would to the Diuines for counſell, and the Prince ought to allow mee ſo to do: and if he will not I will ſay, <hi>wee muſt obey God rather then men.</hi> But if he ſhall commaund me, that I bring into the Citty or not carry out ſome kind of ware or merchandiſe, or that I pay a contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or cuſtome; or that I ward the wals of the Citty; and in ſumme, when he ſhall command mee that, which may ſerue to maintain the tranquillity, quiet and ſecurity of the ſtate, which may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the raiſing of tumults and other nouelties, which might bring with them ſcandall or diſquiet, (thinges which are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to publicke care, where a priuate man ought not to interpoſe his judgement, but follow the iudgement of his Prince:) becauſe in thoſe things the menagement is not of my ſoule, but of things temporall, I ought not to trouble my thoughts about them, but will obey him both for wrath and for conſcience ſake. The care of the publicke tranquillity, belongeth all to the Prince; the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man hath no part at all therein, except the execution: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am not to trouble my thoughts about it. The care of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans ſoule, belongeth not ſolely to the Prelate, the ſubject hath herein the moſt principall part, to him therefore doth it prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally apperteine to thinke vpon it. And by this may one moſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17244:60"/>
cleerely diſcerne the difference betweene the commaundements of Prelates and Princes. For theſe muſt be obeyed, though one ſee not the reaſon, touching the other you muſt be well aduiſed what you do. When the Prince commaundeth, hee appoints a thing which belongeth to him, and to him hath God wholy commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and not to mee otherwiſe then paſſiuely. When the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late commaundeth, hee dealeth with a matter which belongeth more to me then to him, and therefore am I more bound to aduiſe vpon it then hee. But to the Prince I ſtand bound to yeelde abſolute obedience, when hee dea eth with temporall thinges, without conſidering whether it hurt my priuate temporall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, becauſe the publique good, muſt needes be preferred aboue any priuate. But now for the Prelate, I ought not to obey him; if it fall out to bee preiudiciall to the profit of my ſoule, though it would proue exceeding greatly behoofefull to thoſe ends which were aimed at by my Prelate. The whole error ſtands in this, that we giue power to the Prelate ouer matters temporall, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the eccleſiaſticall miniſtery into a ſecular Court judiciall. For to the ſecular power, hath God committed the care of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique tranquillitie, and giuen them authority to impoſe temporall puniſhments, for feare of which it is requiſite that wee bee ſubiect to them, which is meant by for wrath: beſides the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which enioyneth vs to obey them, which makes vp the other branch for conſcience ſake. But to the Eccleſiaſtical, miniſtery hath God committed the care of ſoules, which is not to meddle directly with temporall puniſhments: and therefore hath he not commaunded to obey them for wrath. Of the temporall power, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>For he beareth not the ſword without cauſe;</hi> but of the miniſtery eccleſiaſticall, it is exerciſed <hi>by the ſword of the Spirit which is the word of God.</hi> The concluſion therefore which the author makes, that to the Viccar of Chriſt all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are by the law of God obliged to bee ſubiect &amp; obedient, is to be meant in things ſpirituall and appertayning to the ſaluation of ſoules, and in the court of God, and when hee commaundeth according to his diuine law. But in temporall thinges abſolute Princes are not ſ biect to any other then to God himſelfe, from whome their power is immediately deriued.</p>
            <p>And if the weake hold the Pope to be a God, and that he hath al
<pb facs="tcp:17244:61"/>
power in heauen &amp; in earth: more pleaſing to almighty God is this their weakenes; then their ſtrength who ſeeming to be wiſe, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to abaſe the authority of the vicar of Chriſt; as at this day all Heretiques do. It is not ſo great a matter that the Pope ſhould be reputed a God vpon earth, ſeeing in the pſalme he ſaith of all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I haue ſaid ye are Gods. Neither is it inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that one ſhold ſay that the Pope hath all power in heauen and in earth, ſeeing Chriſt hath ſaid, whatſoeuer thou ſhalt bind vpon earth it ſhalbee bound alſo in the heauens. Which yet is expounded, and meant ſoundly by true and learned Catholiques. And in ſumme I think it may be ſaid with all truth, that the power of the high Biſhoppe is ſo great, that few men arriue to comprehend it. For hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do all that which is neceſſary to the conducing of ſoules to Paradiſe, and can take away all the impediments, which the world or the Deuil, with al their force or craft, are able to oppoſe. Whence it is that Saint <hi>Cyril,</hi> (cited by S, <hi>Thomas</hi> in his <hi>Opuſcle de primatu Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri</hi>) ſaith, that as Chriſt had from the Father, all plenitude of power ouer all the Church; ſo Chriſt gaue to S. <hi>Peter</hi> and to his ſucceſſors all plenitude of power ouer all the Church.</p>

As if we would contradict him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned auarice, by ſaying, it more pleaſeth God, to be a niggard of his own, then to ſpend it in riot &amp; other ſuperfluities: as though there were not the true meane, which is liberality. The right ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſpeech were, it leſſe diſpleaſeth God, to be niggardly, then to be prodigal in riot: but both diſpleaſe him. The ſinne is moſt grieuous to deny the true authoritie graunted by Chriſt to his vicar: yet his ignorance that giueth him more authority then is conuenient, is not praiſeable. Truth is acceptable to God: ignorance when it is inuincible, is not good, but excuſable: it implieth great contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to ſay that any falſe thing pleaſeth God. The Author be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing accuſtomed to ſpeake properly, might haue ſaid, this weaknes of theirs is leſſe diſpleaſing to God, then the ſtrength of Heretiques and we would haue commended him. For ſo ſhould the truth haue
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17244:61"/>
beene vnfolded, that neither the one nor the other of the foreſaide extreames do pleaſe at all. And let not the Author think it inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, if one ſhould ſay that it is good to inſtruct the ſimple people not to giue more authority to the Pope then that which is right &amp; lawfull, for ſo ſaith S. <hi>Gregory.</hi> 2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 7. and yeelds his reaſon. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monendi ſunt ſubditi ne plusquam expedit ſint ſubiecti, ne cum ſtudent pluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neceſſe eſt hominibus ſubiici, compellantur etiam vitia eorum venerari:</hi> could this holy perſonage more plainely confirme the doctrine of <hi>Gerſon? Gerſon</hi> ſaith that thoſe who in ſcrupuloſity of conſcience take the Pope for a God, muſt not be ſuffered to reſt in their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and S. <hi>Gregories</hi> words are, that ſubiects muſt be admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they make not themſelues more ſubiect then is conuenient; but that which is more of importance giues the reaſon of it; becauſe they are inforced to flatter them in their vices whoſe ſubiects they make themſelues more then they ſhould be. Then can you not err if you adde hereunto, that mans cuſtome is to imitate the thinges he reuerenceth; and you may conclude it to be both good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take away this falſe ſuggeſtion. That which follows in the Author, that it is no great matter though the Pope be thought a God ſince all Princes haue the ſtile of Gods hath no inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in it, ſo as we be not ouertaken in the ambiguity of the words: but whilſt that out of this propoſition which hath good ſenſe in it, we draw a conſequence <hi>Papa et Deus constituunt idem tribunal, Papae &amp; Dei idem conſiſtorium;</hi> we ſhall aſcribe to him a kind of diety which <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth not allow. The Author thinks it no inconuenience to ſay, that the Pope hath all power in heauen and in earth, becauſe it is ſaid <hi>quodcunque ligaueris ſuperterram erit ligatum &amp; in coelis,</hi> and yet may it appeare to any that this concluſion is not well drawne from this place, becauſe power belongs to the actiue property, and <hi>quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque,</hi> appertaines to the matter. If I ſhould ſay the Pariſh-prieſt is he that makes all marriages, it doth not therefore follow that he hath all power in matter of marriage. For to ſay <hi>quodcunque ligaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſuper terram erit ligatum &amp; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> coelis</hi> therefore <hi>quocunque modo liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueris</hi> followes not. And this is it which <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth not approue; and thus do I thinke would the Author himſelfe vnderſtand it whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith that thus it is declared, and truly vnderſtood by true and learned Catholiques, becauſe that this propoſition (The Pope hath all power in heauen and in earth) being taken abſolutely is falſe: or
<pb facs="tcp:17244:62"/>
being tied to the true conſtruction, there is much more power both in heauen and in earth which the Pope hath not, then that he hath, and therefore that propoſition which by one inſtance onely doth proue vntrue, hauing more inſtances againſt it then examples for it, is moſt falſe. The Author ſaith, he thinkes he may moſt truly ſay that the Popes authority is ſo great, that few can comprehend it. And I belieue it too, becauſe truth is one and the ſame thing, and falſhood infinite. Many aſcribe to him leſſe then is requiſite and many more, ſo as the reſidue is but ſmall which giue him iuſt that which is his due. The Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his worke <hi>de Romano Pontifice</hi> makes a long diſcourſe preſcribing limits to the Popes authority, and touching many thinges which the Pope him ſelfe cannot do: now, were this diſcourſe very impertinent if his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority could not exceede. And for that he ſaith the Pope can doe all thinges which are neceſſary to conduct a ſoule into paradiſe &amp; can take away all impediments which the world or the Diuell can lay in the way with all their ſtrength and ſubtilty, This propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is faire in ſhew but falſe in deed. To conduct the ſoule of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant into paradiſe, which is yet in the mothers belly and cannot be brought forth aliue, neceſſary it is one way or other to make it par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taker of grace, can the Pope then do it? no truly, for neither can he inſtitute a ſacrament for this purpoſe, nor graunt that the childe ſhoulde bee cut out of the mothers belly: and therefore can not the Pope do any thing neceſſary to conduct this ſoule into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. A man beeing actually in ſome mortall ſinne and in this caſe depriued of his wits cannot: be ſaued vnleſſe he recouer his ſenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and repent himſelfe, can the Pope reſtore him to his wits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? I beleeue he cannot: and yet is this neceſſary for this mans ſaluation. Nothing is more neceſſary to ſaluation then the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall motions of the minde, ouer which S. <hi>Thomas</hi> denieth that the Pope hath any power. Infinite are the things which are neceſſary for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducting a ſoule into paradiſe, which I can ſhew not to be ſubiect to the Popes authority. Yet, if it were Gods will, I wiſh he could (as the Author ſaith) remoue all impediments which the world and the Diuell can lay in the way with all their ſubtilty, for then ſhold we haue neither Turks nor Hereticks. The impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are likewiſe infinite which are dayly caſt in the way by the enemies of the kingdome of Chriſt, for which the Pope muſt content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17244:62"/>
without further remedy then onely to pray <hi>&amp; nonos inducas in tentationem</hi> &amp;c. God hath not onely not giuen authority to the Pope to remoue all impediments, which are laide in the way by the world and the Diuell, but hath thought it for the good of the Church to permit many of them. The Reader may well perceiue with how good reaſon <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth giue admoniſhment that the ſimple people be wel inſtructed, becauſe that here are foure propo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſitions pronounced with one breath by a great man of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which are manifeſtly falſe, &amp; all to inlarge that power which God hath giuen beyond the bounds, within which his diuine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty hath reſtrained it.</p>
            <p>We will ſoone rid our hands of the 12. conſideration becauſe the obiection is but ſhort.</p>
            <p>The 12. conſideration is,<note place="margin">Gerſon</note> that thoſe do nouriſh the contempt of the keyes, who when they ſhould reſiſt the abuſe of them are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided within themſelues, and hinder each other. The truth is that all fauourable and humble endeuours muſt bee vſed with the Pope when vpon ill information hee pronounceth an vniuſt ſentence. But if this humble diligence will not preuaile, then is hold to bee laide of a ſtout and manlike liberty.<note place="margin">Bellarmine</note> This conſideration was to good purpoſe in <hi>Gersons</hi> time, becauſe there being then a ſchiſme of three Popes which did thunder out excommunications each v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon others adherents; it was fit at that time that the faithfull ſhould vnite themſelues to extinguiſh this ſchiſme and make ſmall accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thoſe excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſince it ſtood in doubt which of them was the Vicar of Chriſt, and notwithſtanding the ſaide excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications might ſtill intend the buſineſſe of the vnion of the Church. But now that by Gods grace we haue but one onely Pope and hee vndoubted and certaine; this conſideration is nothing to the purpoſe, nor ſerues for any thing, but to make a new ſchiſme of the members againſt their owne head.</p>
            <p>If the Author conceiue that <hi>Gerſon</hi> wrote this doctrine in a time of ſchiſme let him but looke backe to the eight co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration and hee ſhall plainely perceiue this treatiſe was written after the councell of <hi>Constance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Frier Paolo</note> and at ſuch time as there was but one onely vndoubted Pope, But if the Author haue ſome more ſubtile mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by himſelfe, it is hard to bee gueſt at, though it may well be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, becauſe there is no likely-hoode that hee ſhould not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
<pb facs="tcp:17244:63"/>
the time when the treatiſe was written; but this conſideration being written by <hi>Gerſon,</hi> I ſee not in what manner it can be applied to a former time. It doth likewiſe plainely appeare that it can haue no reference to a time of ſchiſme which happily <hi>Gerſon</hi> might miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt would follow, becauſe there is nothing ſaide of the vnion of the Church, but onely of the meanes how to take away the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes. And further, as long as the Pope is certaine and vndoubted, that reuerend reſpect which <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth aduiſe, vnder the ſtile of fauourable and humble endeuours, is not due vnto him, but doth onely belong to the true vndoubted Biſhope of Rome. And to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute no longer of this matter the Reader reading <hi>Gerſon</hi> and that which the author obiecteth, &amp; conſidering whether there may not be abuſe of the keyes, euen when there is no ſchiſme, and how thoſe which ſhould make reſiſtance are diuided amongſt themſelfes and out of ſimplicity or baſeneſſe hinder each other, ſome giuing countenance to the abuſes which others would willingly take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, may ſee what it is that is here truely and preciſely ſpoken of, and whether the obiection may goe for currant. But that which he ſaith in the concluſion, that this conſideration ſerues for nothing but to raiſe new ſchiſme, can not bee ſaide but by him that will likewiſe affirme that Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> doctrine in the chapter <hi>[Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monendi]</hi> which we haue before alledged is falſe, and that it ſerues to raiſe ſchiſme, when he ſaith, that ſubiects muſt bee admoniſhed that they make not themſelues more ſubiect then is conuenient, leſt they ſhould bee enforced to flatter them in their vices to whome they haue made themſelues more ſubiect then they ſhould be. But this 12. conſideration doth fitly ſerue to take away abuſes in the Church of God, which the faithfull for many ages paſt, haue ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired: It ſerues to keepe the holy Church in peace and tranquillity: Nay rather it ſerues to preuent ſchiſme and diuiſion, becauſe that in theſe latter times many countries and kingdomes haue fallen from the Church of Rome vpon no other occaſion, but becauſe the Pope would euer be enterprizing vpon their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eſtates. Wee may firmely beleeue that <hi>Paulus Quintus</hi> had a good intention to reforme the abuſes which haue bin brought in till this preſent. But ſo great is their violence that it is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile if men of neuer ſo good mindes bee tranſported and caryed away, contrary to their own inclinations to that very point which they minded to auoyde.</p>

            <p>Firſt hee reprehends him for ſpeaking poſitiuely without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that his ſentences, though they were vniuſt, were to bee feared: for it ſeemes by this he would ſay that all vniuſt ſentences are to be feared, though we are to vnderſtand that not all vniuſt ſenten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces are to be feared, but ſuch onely, as though they bee vniuſt are yet of validity: as it is gathered out of <hi>Gratianus.</hi> 11. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. <hi>per to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> To this it may be anſwered that the Commiſſary ſpake in like ſenſe as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> and the holy Canons: for as <hi>S.

So likewiſe can it not be collected out of the Commiſſaries words that all ſentences are to be feared, but thoſe onely as though they be vniuſt are not yet manifeſtly of no validity. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude the ſame ſcandale that is laide to the words of the Commiſſary may in like manner be laide to thoſe of S. <hi>Gregory.</hi>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17244:64"/>
way iniurious, as appeares in the ninth conſideration, or by a volun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tary miſtaking of times, will ſeeme to belieue that <hi>Gerſons</hi> worke was written before the Councell of Conſtance which ſurely was written ſince, as this ſecond booke was likewiſe written ſince that time, becauſe that herein he doth name the foreſaid Councell: and more doth giue the title of Regent to the ſonne of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixth who tooke it not to him till the yeare 1418. which I thought fitte to touch by the way, to ſhew that both theſe bookes were made in the Popedome of <hi>Martinus Quintus,</hi> who was a ſingle and vndou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pope. By which means the common refuge of the Author (who will needes haue it that <hi>Gersons</hi> doctrine was written in a time of ſchiſme) helps nothing for all he ſaith, to auoide the force of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth not deny but that the aſſertion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary may haue ſome good ſenſe in it, becauſe he ſaith the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary muſt be inforced either to expreſſe himſelfe or reuoke his ſentence. But <hi>Gerſon</hi> denies that the aſſertion in the formall ſenſe it hath, can be true, and true it is that he which examineth an aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when it is in <hi>Theſis,</hi> that is vniuerſall, without applying it to the particular occaſion, doth examine it in the formal ſenſe of the wordes. But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> he takes it in that ſenſe which the particular occaſion doth miniſter. Our Author therefore doth well in examining it both wayes, and firſt taking it in <hi>Theſis</hi> ſayth that it followes not of this that all vniuſt ſentences are to be feared, (as <hi>Gerſon</hi> affirmes) but this ſhould be gathered onely of thoſe, as though they be vniuſt are not yet to be accounted nullities, ſince you may conclude as much out of S. <hi>Gregories</hi> ſaying, that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the paſtor, be it iuſt or vniuſt is to be feared, ſeeing that this is ſpoken without diſtinction, yet neuertheles is to be vnderſtood by all men of that which is vniuſt and yet of validity, and concludes in briefe that the ſcandale which is giuen to the words of the Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſary may as well be giuen to the words of Saint <hi>Gregory.</hi> It had been enough to haue ſaid interpretation becauſe this word ſcandall and S. <hi>Gregory</hi> agree not in my opinion ſo well together. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Author ſayth that the ſaying of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> is ſubiect to the ſame interpretation, this is to be vnderſtoode, either as it is ſet downe in S. <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelfe, or as it is in <hi>Gratianus,</hi> or elſe as it is abſolutely ſeparate by it ſelfe, and in any mans mouth that will abuſe it. As it is in S. <hi>Gregory</hi> I ſay it is not ſubiect to this ſenſe: for he ſpeakes in
<pb facs="tcp:17244:65"/>
this place of the paſtors vniuſt ſentence taken indifferently either with validity or without it, either with or without nullity: but <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menda</hi> ſignifies <hi>non per contemptum ſpernenda,</hi> and all men affirme that <hi>omnis ſententia etiam iniusta, etiam nulla</hi> as <hi>ſententia paſtoris non eſt conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And the Authour might well haue markt this declaration in <hi>Gerſon,</hi> where he ſayth a little after, that the ſaying of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> might haue good ſenſe in it but not the Commiſſaries, who comes in with his <hi>obseruare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the Author will ſpeake of this ſaying, as it ſtands in the <hi>Decretals,</hi> let him heare if he pleaſe after what ſort the Compilator ſpeaks in the chapter <hi>Si Episcopus,</hi> § <hi>Praemiſſis auctoritatibus Gregorius non dicit sententia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniuſte latam eſſe seruanda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sed timendam, ſicut &amp; Vrba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, timenda eſt ergo, id est non ex superbia contemnenda.</hi> If <hi>Gratianus</hi> the Monke were liuing at this preſent and would take vpon him the defence of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> he could not ſpeake more to the purpoſe then that he ſaid 400. yeares ſince. But if the Author will take S. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> ſaying ſo apart it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be compared to that of the Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe this word <hi>timere</hi> doth admit co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which <hi>obseruare</hi> doth not, and then no man of learning will alledge a ſaying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking back to the very ſpring and taking it in the true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, out of which none who writes with ſincerity will ſeeke to carry it. By which you may ſee what great difference there is betwixt the modeſt and holy manner of ſpeech of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> and the abſurd and tirannicall wordes of the Commiſſary. But let vs paſſe to the ſecond part.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note>Secondly <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth finde fault that the commiſſary ſhould ſay his ſentences, though they were vniuſt, were to bee feared and obeyed, becauſe obeyed is one thing and feared, another. The iniuſtice of a tyrant may bee feared, but not obeyed, and he that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17244:65"/>
ſaith iniuſtice is to be obeyed, ſpeaks an vntruth &amp; reſts in an error.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwere that the Commiſſary (as may bee imagined) ſpake not of commanding any vniuſt matter, but ſpake of a ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence of excommunication as it is a penalty which depriues a man of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the ſacraments and conuerſing in ſociety with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and in this ſenſe it may very well bee ſaid that an vniuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of excommunication ought to be both feared and obeyed: becauſe that to feare an excommunication, and obey an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication haue no great difference; For hee that feares it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaines from receiuing the Sacraments and conuerſing with the faithfull and ſo obeyes it; and hee that doth not obey it, but doth conuerſe with the faithfull and receiue the Sacraments doth not feare it. So as <hi>Gerſon</hi> hath equiuocated betwixt a ſentence which commaunds an action and a ſentence which commaunds forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from doing any thing; and hauing grounded his diſcourſe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon an equiuocation, no meruaile though he haue built it in the ayre.</p>
            <p>For defence of the Commiſſaries aſſertion in <hi>Hipotheſis</hi> appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the occaſion hee firſt alleadgeth that the Comiſſary (as may be imagined) ſpake not of commaunding any vniuſt matter,<note place="margin">Frier Paolo.</note> but of the ſentence of excommunication as it is a penalty; and making difference betwixt theſe two, concludes [that] <hi>Gerſon</hi> hauing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocated betwixt a ſentence that commaunds an action, and a ſentence which enioynes forbearance from doing any thing, and grounded his diſcourſe vpon an equiuocation, no meruaile though hee haue built it in the ayre. The Reader may ſee how our Author not knowing of what ſentence the Commiſſary ſpake, fals to gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ſaide that it may bee imagined he ſpake not of commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any vniuſt matter but of a ſentence of excommunication as it is a penalty, and then concludes affirmatiuely that <hi>Gerſon</hi> hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocated. <hi>Gerſon</hi> hath not equiuocated but as the occaſion doth require; as I will ſhew you. Hee knew the ſpeach was of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an vniuſt matter; and hath therein expreſt himſelfe further in this little treatiſe. But the Author is the man that buildes in the ayre, who preſuppoſing a matter and ſaying [as may bee imagined] doth thereupon reſolutely condemne <hi>Gerſon</hi> of equiuocation, as if that his [as may bee imagined] and [thus certainely it is] had the ſame ſignification. But the Author partly aware of his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror

helps it with ſaying.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note>Put caſe the Commiſſary ſpake of a ſentence which ſhould commaund any matter vpon paine of excommunication hee hath not ſpoken ill though it were ſo. For ſuch a kinde of ſentence, either it commaunds a matter which is apparently good; as to make reſtitution of an other mans goodes; or a matter eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently bad, as to rob or blaſpheme; or a matter which is in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether it bee good or bad: as to aſſiſt in a warre which is not knowne whether it bee iuſt or vniuſt; if it co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>maund a matter which is apparantly good, it muſt be both obeyed and feared; that is to ſay, it muſt be obeyed by doing that which is commaunded for feare of falling into excommunication, and ſo it may fall out that ſuch a ſentence may be vniuſt. If there haue not bin three pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent admonitions; yet may it bee of validity, becauſe that which it commaunds is good; It is thundered out by one that had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for it, and one admonition at leaſt hath preceded. If the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be doubtfull whether it commaund that which is ill or not ill yet is it to bee obeyed and feared, becauſe that in a caſe of doubt the ſubiect muſt ſubmit himſelfe to the iudgement of his ſuperior, and not ſtand vpon his owne opinion, as is ſaide before, and is the common doctrine of the holy fathers. If a ſentence ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund a matter which is euidently a ſinne, then is it neither to be obeyed nor feared. And whoſoeuer ſaith it ſhould be obeyed, is in an error: and vpon an aſſertion of this kind <hi>Gerſons</hi> fiue propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may bee true. For there is no queſtion but thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is falſe that a ſentence which binds a man to ſin ſhould be obeyed; &amp; it is vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the ſame ſentence ſhould both commaund ſinne, and likewiſe tie a man to obedience. And more, that ſentence is erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in point of manners, becauſe it teacheth to doe ill; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in matter of faith, becauſe he that ſaith it is lawful to do ill is an Heretique; and if he repent not himſelfe he muſt bee put into the handes of the ſecular power that hee may bee puniſhed according to his deſerts, and a ſentence of this nature muſt not onely not be o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beyed, but alſo not ſo much as feared, becauſe our ſauiour ſaith <hi>nolite timere eos qui occidunt corpus</hi> and a man ſhould ſooner chooſe to die then obey ſuch a law. Whereby there can bee no diſcouery made of this fourth part which <hi>Gerſon</hi> produceth, which is that ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences either ought or may be feared, yet not obeyed, ſpeaking of that feare which is an inducement to obedience: though there
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17244:66"/>
may bee a naturall feare of a tyrant which commaundes wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But neither in this hath the Commiſſary erred, becauſe hee alwaies ſpake of ſuch a ſentence as though it were vniuſt, was yet of validity, as this can not bee which commaunds ſinne; and may be plainely condemned of a nullity. See then how the whole dicourſe of <hi>Gerſon</hi> is built in the ayre; And he which tranſlated it &amp; brought it to light to teach the <hi>Venetians</hi> to diſpiſe the Popes ſentences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iuſt and of validity, ſhewes himſelfe to bee more fraught with malice then iudgement.</p>
            <p>For the better expreſſing the meaning of <hi>Gerſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Frier Paolo.</note> and declaring the truth, it is very neceſſary (ouer and aboue tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which we haue ſaide before that it is no hard matter to finde ſentences which are to bee feared yet not obeyed) to proceede with the ſame diſtinction the author vſeth, that a ſentence muſt either commaund a thing which is manifeſtly good, or plainely bad, or that which is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And as for the firſt part when the thing which is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is manifeſtly good and equitable, wee hold with the Author that it is to bee obeyed. For the third part which imports a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, for feare of his equiuocations wee muſt diſtinguiſh this worde doubt, as wee haue done before, into that which goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an orderly admonition, and that which followes after. The firſt doth not tie vs to obedience but to take counſell onely, and then if vpon conſultation the doubt can not bee ouercome, wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with him that the ſubiect is then bound to follow the opinion of his ſuperior and not his owne.</p>
            <p>And I would craue pardon of the Reader in that I ſo often repeat this doctrine, becauſe the author comes out ſo often with his equi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uocations to make Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſtians runne blindly forward in beeing led by other mens paſſions. In the ſecond caſe when a bad matter is comaunded vpon paine of excommunication, and a time ſet down for the fact, or els the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication to take effect, this ſentence hath two parts: the one which commaunds obedience to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction within the time preſcribed, and the other which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds forbearance from the Communion: if it bee not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the ſaide time be expired. As for the firſt part, I ſay it is ſinne to feare it as the author requires, and he that feares it in that ſort doth commit ſinne: and here that which he alleageth is properlie verified, <hi>nolite timere eos qui occidunt corpus:</hi> but for the
<pb facs="tcp:17244:67"/>
ſecond part, which is forbearing the Communion, it is more then the ſubiect is bound to; but if hee will doe it of himſelfe (beecauſe hee will not tranſgreſſe the other iniunction) hee doth not offend. And thus ſaith <hi>Gerſon</hi> in theſe wordes, which the author muſt needes haue reade, becauſe in ſome caſes they may bee feared by timorous conſciences, yet notwiſtanding they are not to be obeyed: for there is great difference in ſaying they are to bee obeyed, and they are to be feared: to obey a ſentence of excommunication, is vnderſtood by <hi>Gerſon</hi> to execute the iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, either by that meanes not to incurre the ſentence of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or if it bee incurred yet to be abſolued. But to feare an excommunication, <hi>Gerſon</hi> takes that to bee, to forbeare the Communion. A ſentence of excommunication ioyned to an iniunction which commaunds an vniuſt act, hee which obeyes it doth ſinne, whereas he that feares it only ſinnes not, though he be not bound to feare it. Wherefore there is great diffrence in ſaying, <hi>Our ſentences, though they be vniuſt, ought to be feared,</hi> becauſe this ſignifies a forbearing of the Communion, for the reuerence is had of them, and the Commiſſary ſpeaking in this ſort had fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led no otherwiſe then in ſaying <hi>ought,</hi> in ſteede of <hi>may:</hi> but when he ſaid they ought to bee obeyed, he committed a greater fault, becauſe they not onely not ought, but further, not ſo much as can be obeyed without ſinning, yet may they be feared, though that be more then needs. And this is the fourth part expreſſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by <hi>Gerſon,</hi> which the author ſaith is not to be found, though it may eaſily be found both in Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Gratianus,</hi> by any that will enter into conſideration of the matter without affecting contradiction. But the author, as it ſeemes, not well aſſured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of what the Commiſſary ſpake, yet here as if he ſpake vpon better ground, ſaith neither in this yet hath the Commiſſary erred, becauſe he euer ſpake of an vniuſt ſentence, yet ſuch a one as was of validitie, as this is not which commaunds ſinne: which enforceth mee to make a little digreſſion to declare the fact which is the ſubiect of this booke.</p>
            <p>Before the councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and about the yeare 1399. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt king of <hi>France,</hi> called an aſſembly of the Clergy &amp; Scholemen of his kingdome, where amongſt other thinges, it was concluded: that the Romiſh Buls of reſeruatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and papall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17244:67"/>
ſhould not be admitted, but that electiue benefices, ſhould be conferred by election, and the preſentations of others ſhould be made by the Ordinaries; which decree that it might be the better obſerued was many times renued within the twenty yeares follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, as well by other decrees, made by Churchmen of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as by acts of Parliament, which were often renued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued notwithſtanding all lets and impediments, which were laid in the way by Briefes and Commiſſions from the court of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the obeying of them. Now it plainely appeares in the ſecond propoſition, that <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſpake of a Commiſſary which went into France vpon ſome ſuch occaſion, and that the time in which <hi>Gerſon</hi> wrote, was in the Popedome of <hi>Martinus Quintus</hi> may bee ſeene in the ſame Propoſition, where it is ſaid that for 20. yeares ſpace, the king held a councell of Prelates, which councell (as <hi>Guagninus</hi> reports) was firſt aſſembled in the foreſaide yeare 1399. And in the third propoſition when <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſpake of the Sonne of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt he vſed theſe words, <hi>To his lawfull ſonne now Regent.</hi> who as <hi>Francis Belforeſt</hi> doth teſtifie, tookel to him this title in the yeare 1418. So as by all theſe circumſtances, it is to bee gathered, that this worke of <hi>Gerſons</hi> was written after the yeare 1418. and before 1422. when <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt dyed. If then <hi>Martinus Quintus</hi> was elected in 1417. it is plaine the booke was written in his Popedome: beſide that <hi>Gerſon</hi> himſelfe in the fourth propoſition doth nominate the councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> as then paſt. Then muſt it needs bee that the Commiſſary commaunded the execution of ſome Papall prouiſion, contrary to the orders ſet downe by the foreſaid conuocation: which according to <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was to commaund an vniuſt thing, and did therfore conteine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable errors againſt publicke iuſtice, and in his opinion did tend directly to an vndue vſurpation. All which if it had beene obſerued by our author hee had ſurely forborne to ſay that the Commiſſary ſpake of vniuſt ſentences, but ſuch as were of validity, ſeeing plainely in the fourth propoſition that this Commiſſaries ſentence is a proteſtation made againſt the foreſaid actes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and for this reaſon <hi>Gerſon</hi> held it of no validity. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary if he had beene a man of conſcience could not haue held his own ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tences vniuſt: but like one that how euer the world went would be obeyed, to eaſe himſelfe of trouble in iuſtifying his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dats
<pb facs="tcp:17244:68"/>
writ in a common proceſſe, that his ſentences, whether they were iuſt or vniuſt, were to bee obeyed. If vniuſt ſentences might ſuffer a diſtinction, of ſuch as were of validitie and ſuch as were not of validitie, hee had not freed himſelfe of all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, becauſe hee might yet bee encountered with the queſtion of validitie: and therefore the Commiſſary endeauoured in one ambiguous word to include the generall, that neceſſary it was to obey all his ſentences, and by this meanes thought to purchaſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to that which hee particularly intended: not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to this preſent occaſion, wherein many diſtruſting their own abilities in ſhewing the iuſtice of the Popes mandats to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſay that the Pope is to bee obeyed, though hee commaund vniuſt things. Surely I cannot but much wonder how the author treating of a queſtion which is grounded vpon a thing in fact, ſhould conclude co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the truth of the ſtory. See then I pray you how all <hi>Gerſons</hi> diſcourſe is built in the ayre.

               <note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note>To this diſcourſe <hi>Gerſon</hi> doth add certain propoſitions to ſhew that which the moſt Chriſtian king was both able and ought to do in defence of the liberty of the French church: of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions it is not very neceſſary to diſcourſe in this place, Firſt, becauſe they are all grounded vpon this principle that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a councell is aboue the Popes authority: for vpon no other reaſon will <hi>Gerſon</hi> haue it that the Pope cannot change the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cannons, vpon which the French Church did then ground their liberty, but becauſe hee did belieue that thoſe Canons which were made by the councel, could not be ſubiect to the Popes will and authority. Now that this principall is declared to be falſe let vs not belieue that the <hi>Venetians</hi> can hould it for true. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe that ſince <hi>Gerſons</hi> time; In the councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth that pragmaticall act was abrogated, which the French churches defended, &amp; agrement was made betwixt Pope <hi>Leo</hi> and the moſt Chriſtian king; ſo as now there is no more talke of the liberty of the French church in preiudice of the Pope. But the moſt Chriſtian king and all the Biſhops of France are at peace and vnitie with their mother which is the church of Rome, and
<pb facs="tcp:17244:68"/>
likewiſe with their Father, which is the Pope Chriſts vicar, &amp; Saint Peters ſucceſſor. Thirdly, becauſe this liberty of the French church which <hi>Gerſon</hi> writes of, hath no ſympathie with that liberty which is now pretended by the ſtate of Venice; becauſe that was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon auncient Canons, and this is contrary as well to the ancient Canons as the moderne.<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>Gerſon</hi> hauing intention to demonſtrate in eight propoſitions that which the moſt Chriſtian King was to doe in defence of the liberty of the french Church, defending it from Buls of reſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Papal prouiſions, and other abuſes of the court of Rome vſed in thoſe times ſets downe eight propoſitions which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth wiſely obſerue to bee better diſſembled and paſt ouer then handled, ſeeing plainly that to endeuour to confute them were to confirme them, and to eſtabliſh that which before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted; That Princes both ought and might oppoſe themſelues to ſuch commandements of Prelates as were exorbitant and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full: and therefore excuſeth himſelfe from treating of theſe eight propoſitions for three cauſes. Firſt becauſe they are grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this principle, that the authority of a Councell is aboue the Popes authority; and this he ſaith he hath declared before to bee falſe. But he might haue added, that notwithſtanding his declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is both held and maintained by the Vniuerſities of France, of which <hi>Nauarra</hi> and others giue ſufficient teſtimony. Secondly, becauſe that in the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> vnder Pope <hi>Leo</hi> that prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Act was abrogated; ſo as at this day there is no more talke of the liberty of the French Church. The Author takes vs here to be very ſimple and ignorant in matter of hiſtory, as if we knew not that the liberty of the french Church of which <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſpeakes was one thing, and the pragmaticall decree another. The one being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Gerſons</hi> time; but the decree was made by <hi>Charles</hi> the 7. about the yeare 1440. long after this booke was written, in which his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Charles</hi> the 6. was mentioned as then liuing. But why, ſaith he, not here as wel, that vpon the annulling of this pragmatical decree by <hi>Leo,</hi> the Vniuerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> made an appeale to the next coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell? Hee preſuppoſeth fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her that wee doe not ſo much as know what is a pragmaticall decree, and what a particular order, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this latter doth abrogate the former in the whole or in certain parts onely. But the moſt bold and wilfull part of all is to belieue
<pb facs="tcp:17244:69"/>
that we are lockt vp in a priſon, and know not ſo much as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occurrences of the world, and are ignorant whether in France there be dayly appeales from eccleſiaſticall ſentences to the Court of Parliament <hi>tanquam ab abuſu,</hi> and whether that Court doth take knowledge of them. Surely the Author would be well content we were me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this ſort, and that we knew no more of the world then what ſtood with the benefit of Church-men onely, and blinded in extreame ignorance wee ſhould hold them in admiration iuſt like Gods and Oracles. The third cauſe which he alleadgeth for not touching the eight propoſitions of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> is becauſe the liberty of the French Church which <hi>Gerſon</hi> writes of, was grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Canons, and this of the Venetians is contrary both to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Canons and thoſe of latter time. What truth there is in this laſt ſaying of his I will not ſpeake. France is not the country of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan from whence we muſt expect aduertiſements but once a yeare to know how that kingdome is gouerned. All the French writers make mention of the liberty of their Church, and they are al colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into one volume printed at <hi>Paris</hi> 1594. out of which I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſomewhat to this purpoſe, and leaue it to be iudged of by the Reader. And thus beſide many more particulars it is plainely ſet downe in that booke.</p>
            <p>The Popes can neither commaund nor giue order in any thing either in generall or particular which concernes temporall matters in the countries and territories vnder the ſoueraignty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the moſt Chriſtian King; and if ſo bee they commaund or determine any thing, the kinges ſubiects, yea though they bee Churchmen, are not in this reſpect bound to obey them.</p>
            <p>Although the Popes ſupremacy bee acknowledged in ſpiritual cauſes yet notwithſtanding is there no way giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in France by any maner of meanes to an abſolute and infinite power, but it is reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and limited by Conons and rules of auntient councelles of the Church which are receiued in this kingdome. <hi>&amp; in hoc maxime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtit libertas Eccleſiae Gallicanae.</hi>

rule and diſcipline of their countries: and in theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cels the Kings themſelues haue cauſed preſcriptions, chapters, lawes, ordinances and pragmaticall ſanctions to bee made vnder their names and authorities: and at this day there are many to bee read in the collection of decrees which are receaued by the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, and ſome of them approued by the generall counceles.</p>
            <p>The Pope can by no meanes ſend into France his Legates a <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere</hi> with commiſſion to reforme, adiudge, beſtowe, diſpenſe or ſuch like matters, which are vſually ſpecified in the Buls of their commiſſion, if it be not at the requeſt of the moſt Chriſtian King, or at leaſt wiſe by his conſent; and the Legate is not to execute his c mmiſſion but vpon promiſe made to the King in writing, and a ſolemne oth taken by his holy orders, not to exerciſe the ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in any kingdome, country, land or Lordſhip vnder his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection but for ſuch time onely as ſhal ſtand with the Kings liking; and as ſoone as the Legate ſhalbe aduertiſed of the kinges pleaſure to the contrary, he ſhall preſentiy deſiſt and ſtay. In like manner he ſhal not vſe any part of his commiſſion, but ſuch as may be with the Kings liking, &amp; conformable to his wil, without attempting or doing any thing in preiudice of the holy decrees, generall councels immunities, liberties, and priuiledges of the French Church, and the Vniuerſities, and publike Colledges of this kingdom. And to this end are the Commiſſions of the Legates preſented to the court of Parliament, where they are ſeene, examined, approued, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and regiſtred with ſuch prouiſoes as ſhall ſeeme expedient to the Court for the good of the kingdome. With which prouiſoes, further, are all differences and contentions adiudged which do riſe vpon occaſion of the Legats actions, and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The Prelats of the French church, though they bee ſent for by the Pope vpon what occaſion ſoeuer, yet are they not to go out of the kingdome, without commaundement, licence, or paſport from the king.</p>
            <p>The clauſes inſerted in the Bull, <hi>in Coena Domini,</hi> and thoſe in particular in the time of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond and others after him, haue no admittance in France, in as much as concernes the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and priuileges of the French church, and the rights of the King and his kingdome.</p>
            <p>The Pope can neither take vpon himſelfe nor commit to others
<pb facs="tcp:17244:70"/>
the triall of rightes, preheminences and priuileges of the crowne of France and the appurtenances, neither doth the king plead or debate his right and pretenſions but in his owne court.</p>
            <p>The French Church hath euer held, that although by eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall rules, or (as Saint <hi>Cyrill</hi> ſaith writing to Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi>) by auncient cuſtome of all churches, generall councels are not to be aſſembled or ſolemniſed without the Pope <hi>(claue non errante)</hi> who is acknowledged for head and primate of the whole militant church, and the common father of all Chriſtians, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be determined or concluded without him or his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is it not to be thought or imagined that he ſhould bee aboue the vniuerſall councels, but it is rather held that he is bound to ſubmit himſelfe to the decrees and reſolutions of this vniuerſall councell, as to the commaundements of the church, which is ſpouſe to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and is chiefly repreſented by this congregation.</p>
            <p>The Buls or Apoſtolique letters of citation, bee they of preſent execution, or thundered out for admonition, or of any other ſort, are not to bee executed in France without a <hi>Pareatis</hi> from the king or from his officers, and ſuch execution as may be done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der permiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is done by the ordinary iudg appointed by the king, &amp; with the kings authoritie, not <hi>auctoritate Apostolica,</hi> to auoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion which would grow by the mixture of iuriſdictions.</p>
            <p>The Pope can impoſe no penſions vpon benefices of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which haue cures of ſoules, nor vpon others, except it bee by conſent of the incumbents, &amp; conformable to the holy decrees of councels and canonicall conſtitutions, or elſe for the profit of ſuch as do reſigne vpon ſuch expreſſe conditions, or to let peace betwixt parties which are at ſtrife and in ſute about a litigious benefice.</p>
            <p>The liberties of the French Church are preſerued by diligent obſeruing that all Buls and diſpatches which come from the Court of Rome be ſeene and viſited, to knowe whether there bed any thing in them which might be in any ſort preiudiciall to the rights and liberties of the French Church, and the authority of the King, of which there is yet to bee ſeene an expreſſe ordinance made by <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, and imitated by the predeceſſours of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. which were then vaſſals of the crowne of France,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17244:70"/>
and likewiſe by himſelfe in an Edict made at <hi>Madril</hi> in the yeare 1543. which was put in practiſe in Spaine &amp; other countries of his obedience with more rigor, and leſſe reſpect then in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>They are likewiſe preſerued by appeales which are interpoſed to the future councell, of which many preſidents (euen of latter times are to be ſeen, as of appeales made by the Vniuerſity of Paris from Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. <hi>Benedict,</hi> the 11. <hi>Pius</hi> the 2. <hi>Leo.</hi> the 10. and others.</p>
            <p>Were I not reſtrained by the breuity which in reaſon I muſt vſe in this apology, I might here recite the arreſts and acts of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matter of iudgements in criminall cauſes, where it is deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that in France the Clergie men of whatſoeuer order they be, may not onely bee apprehended by the ſecular magiſtrat and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge for common treſpaſſes, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged by the laity for heynous offences; and ſuch for which they claime priuiledge. And further, when for an ordinary fault a man is twice put ouer to the Eccleſiaſticall power, the third time he is held incorrigible &amp; is adiudged by the ſecular. The arreſts may be ſeen in all the French Lawyers and particularly in <hi>Gio: Papons</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections. L. 1. r. 5. art. 4. 9. 30. 31. 33. 34. 35. 44. 45. 46. 47. By this it may appeare to all men that that which the Author ſaith is moſt true, that the liberty of the French Church is grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ancient Canons though it be not therefore true that they are grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely; but further vpon the law of nature, &amp; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity &amp; reaſon. It may further be ſeen, that that which the Author ſaith is not true, that at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t there is no more ſpeach of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch church: but rather that moſt floriſhing &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty kingdome doth employ as much care &amp; ſtudy for conſeruing it ſelfe at this preſent as it hath done in times paſt. And comparing this liberty with that which the ſtate of Venice doth acknowledge to holde of God, and intend to preſerue with all their power, it may appeare that there is no greater difference, than ſuch as the difference of the countries doth neceſſarily require. It may rather be ſeen t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
